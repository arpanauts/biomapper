# Parallel Development Execution Order for Biomapper Actions

## Overview
This document specifies the optimal execution order for developing biomapper action types in parallel using the **enhanced organizational structure**. Each task can be assigned to independent Claude Code instances following the **mandatory Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach.

## Enhanced Organization Integration

All development tasks now follow the enhanced organizational structure optimized for scalability:

## Key Principles
1. **TDD Mandatory**: All actions must write failing tests first using Red-Green-Refactor cycle
2. **Enhanced Organization**: All actions follow the new entity-based directory structure
3. **Parallel Development**: Actions within each week can be developed simultaneously
4. **Shared Components**: Leverage algorithms/ and utils/ for code reuse
5. **Mock Data Initially**: Don't wait for dependencies - use mock data
6. **Integration Testing**: Test with real data once dependencies are ready
7. **Entity-Specific Focus**: Build for one entity type, not generic solutions

---

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Delay Development

#### Week 1 Risks
- **UniProt extraction complexity**: More edge cases than expected
- **Bridge matching performance**: Slower than anticipated with large datasets

**Mitigation**: Focus on basic functionality first, optimize later

#### Week 2 Risks  
- **Multiple ID system complexity**: HMDB, InChIKey, CHEBI extraction harder than expected
- **CTS API reliability**: External service downtime or rate limits

**Mitigation**: Build robust error handling and caching from start

#### Week 3 Risks
- **Fuzzy matching performance**: Chemistry test name matching too slow
- **Vendor differences**: More complex than anticipated

**Mitigation**: Start with simple string matching, enhance incrementally

### Success Dependencies

#### Critical Path
1. **Week 1 success enables Week 2**: Protein patterns guide metabolite development
2. **EXTRACT actions are essential**: All subsequent actions depend on extraction
3. **TDD discipline**: Must be maintained for quality and speed

#### Early Warning System
- If any Week 1 action takes >2x estimated time, reassess complexity
- If test coverage drops below 85%, require additional testing
- If integration fails, prioritize mock data compatibility
