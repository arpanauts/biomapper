# Protein Strategy Refinement Log

## Master Strategy: `prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive.yaml`

This document tracks ALL refinements made to the Arivale→KG2C progressive protein strategy before propagating to the other 4 protein strategies.

---

## Version History

- **v1.0** - Original recovered strategy (basic 8-step pattern)

## v2.1 Implementation Summary

### What's Been Added:

1. **Progressive Export at Each Stage**
   - Stage-specific TSV files showing new matches at each step
   - Enables analysis of which methods work best

2. **Confidence-Based Splitting**
   - High confidence (≥0.8): Most reliable matches
   - Medium confidence (0.6-0.8): Good matches needing review
   - Low confidence (<0.6): Questionable matches

3. **Comprehensive Statistics**
   - Progressive statistics JSON
   - Stage improvements CSV
   - Provenance distribution CSV
   - Confidence distribution JSON
   - Execution metadata with timestamps

4. **Google Drive Integration**
   - Auto-organization by strategy name and version
   - Timestamped run folders
   - Optional (only runs if GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID provided)
   - Won't fail pipeline if sync fails

5. **Bilateral Unmapped Tracking**
   - Tracks unmapped from BOTH source and target
   - Helps identify gaps in both datasets

### Key Parameters Added:

```yaml
parameters:
  gdrive_folder_id: "${GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID:-}"  # Optional
  high_confidence_threshold: 0.8
  medium_confidence_threshold: 0.6
```

### Actions Still Needed (Potential):

- [ ] GENERATE_VISUALIZATION (for charts/graphs)
- [ ] GENERATE_HTML_REPORT (for human-readable report)
- [ ] CHECKPOINT_PROGRESS (for resumability)

These may not exist yet and might need creation.

## Propagation Strategy

Once v2.1 is complete and tested, propagate to:

1. `prot_arv_to_spoke_uniprot_v2_progressive.yaml`
2. `prot_ukb_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive.yaml`
3. `prot_ukb_to_spoke_uniprot_v2_progressive.yaml`
4. `prot_arv_ukb_comparison_v2_progressive.yaml`

### Changes to Propagate:
- [ ] Progressive stage structure
- [ ] Enhanced output organization
- [ ] Google Drive sync
- [ ] Comprehensive statistics
- [ ] Provenance tracking
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Strategy-Specific Adjustments:
- **ARV↔UKB**: Needs bidirectional comparison logic
- **→SPOKE**: May need different extraction logic
- **UKB→**: Different source file structure

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ Test Infrastructure Created
- Small test datasets (10 proteins each)
- Test strategy YAML
- Comprehensive test script
- API server integration testing

### ⚠️ Discovery: Action Import Issue
Actions must be explicitly imported to register. The enhanced organization structure means actions in subdirectories (entities/proteins/*, io/*) aren't auto-imported.

**Solution**: Import actions explicitly in API main.py:
```python
# biomapper-api/app/main.py
from biomapper.core.strategy_actions.entities.proteins.annotation import (
    extract_uniprot_from_xrefs,
    normalize_accessions
)
from biomapper.core.strategy_actions.entities.proteins.matching import multi_bridge
from biomapper.core.strategy_actions.io import sync_to_google_drive_v2
```

### ⚠️ Discovery: TypedStrategyAction Inheritance Issue
PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS wasn't inheriting from TypedStrategyAction properly.

**Solution**: Updated class declaration and added required methods:
```python
@register_action("PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS")
class ProteinExtractUniProtFromXrefsAction(
    TypedStrategyAction[ExtractUniProtFromXrefsParams, ExtractUniProtFromXrefsResult]
):
    def get_params_model(self) -> type[ExtractUniProtFromXrefsParams]:
        return ExtractUniProtFromXrefsParams
    
    def get_result_model(self) -> type[ExtractUniProtFromXrefsResult]:
        return ExtractUniProtFromXrefsResult
```

### 🔄 Current Testing Status
- [x] Created test infrastructure
- [x] Fixed action import issues
- [x] Fixed TypedStrategyAction inheritance
- [ ] Complete full strategy execution
- [ ] Verify output file generation
- [ ] Test Google Drive sync

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run test suite
poetry run python /tmp/test_protein_mapping.py

# Basic validation
poetry run biomapper validate prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive

# Dry run (no actual processing)
poetry run biomapper execute prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive --dry-run

# Small test dataset
poetry run biomapper execute prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive \
  --limit 10 \
  --output-dir /tmp/test_proteins

# Full run with monitoring
poetry run biomapper execute prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v2_progressive \
  --verbose \
  --monitor \
  --output-dir /tmp/biomapper/proteins/arivale_kg2c
```

## Notes & Observations

### What's Working Well:
- Progressive pattern is clear and logical
- Type-safe actions prevent errors
- Statistics tracking provides visibility

### Challenges Encountered:
- Need to determine if GENERATE_ENHANCEMENT_REPORT action exists
- May need to create custom visualization actions
- Google Drive authentication needs setup

### Questions to Resolve:
1. Should we export at each stage or only at the end?
2. What confidence thresholds are appropriate?
3. How much detail in provenance tracking?
4. Should we version the output files?

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Add comprehensive export structure** - Multiple TSV/CSV files by confidence and method
2. **Integrate Google Drive sync** - Add as final step
3. **Test with sample data** - Validate all outputs generate correctly
4. **Create HTML report template** - Human-readable summary
5. **Add visualization generation** - Charts and graphs
