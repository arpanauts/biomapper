- **Status**: COMPLETED - All actions implemented

### 3. **three_way_metabolomics_implementation_plan.md**
- **Reason**: Completed implementation plan for three-way analysis
- **Key Content**: Plan for THREE_WAY_METABOLOMICS_COMPLETE strategy
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Strategy operational

### 4. **cts_qdrant_implementation_plan.md**
- **Reason**: Completed implementation of CTS client and Qdrant integration
- **Key Content**: Technical plan for external service integration
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Both systems operational

### 5. **RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md**
- **Reason**: Interim report on resource management (superseded by new architecture)
- **Key Content**: Resource handling analysis
- **Status**: SUPERSEDED - New job persistence system in place

### 6. **three_way_metabolomics_mapping_strategy.yaml**
