# Biomapper Project Status Summary

## Date: 2024-01-13

## Executive Summary

The biomapper project has reached a critical juncture where protein mapping strategies are ready for parallel development, and metabolite mapping can begin based on lessons learned. This document summarizes the current state and next steps.

## 🎯 Current Focus: v2.1 Protein Mapping Strategy

### What Works ✅
- Context handling between actions (MockContext solution implemented)
- Data flow as list of dicts between actions
- Basic LOAD, EXTRACT, NORMALIZE, EXPORT actions
- Test infrastructure with TDD approach

### What Needs Work 🚧
- Composite identifier handling (comma-separated UniProt IDs)
- MERGE_DATASETS parameter compatibility
- HTML report generation
- Visualization generation
- One-to-many mapping statistics
- Production dataset testing

## 📊 Architecture Decisions Made

### Context Management Solution
After extensive debugging, we've settled on:
```python
# Universal context handling pattern
if isinstance(context, dict):
    ctx = context
elif hasattr(context, '_dict'):  # MockContext
    ctx = context._dict
else:  # StrategyExecutionContext
    ctx = adapt_context(context)
```

### Data Format Standard
- All data between actions: **list of dicts**
- Conversion when needed: `pd.DataFrame(data)`
- Storage format: `df.to_dict("records")`

### Action Organization

## 🚀 Parallel Work Packages Ready

### Package 1: Composite Identifiers
**Owner:** [Unassigned]
**File:** `configs/parallel_prompts/PROMPT_1_COMPOSITE_IDENTIFIERS.md`
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks production testing
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### Package 2: Merge & HTML Reporting
**Owner:** [Unassigned]
**File:** `configs/parallel_prompts/PROMPT_2_MERGE_AND_REPORTING.md`
**Priority:** HIGH - Needed for stakeholder communication
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

### Package 3: Visualization Generation
**Owner:** [Unassigned]
**File:** `configs/parallel_prompts/PROMPT_3_VISUALIZATION.md`
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Nice to have
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Protocol

### Mandatory TDD Workflow
1. **Write test FIRST** - Defines exact behavior
2. **Run test** - Expect failure (RED)
3. **Implement minimal code** - Make test pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** - Improve while keeping tests green
5. **Coverage check** - Minimum 80%

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run specific test
poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/test_action.py -xvs

# Check coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=biomapper --cov-report=html

# Verify code quality
poetry run ruff format .
poetry run ruff check . --fix
poetry run mypy biomapper
```

## 🔬 Metabolite Mapping Next Phase

### Handoff Document Ready
**Location:** `configs/metabolite_strategies/METABOLITE_MAPPING_CONTEXT.md`

### Key Lessons Transferred
- Context handling issues and solutions
- Composite identifier patterns
- One-to-many mapping tracking
- Progressive matching strategy
- API rate limiting approaches
- Confidence scoring framework

### Metabolite-Specific Challenges Documented
- Stereoisomer handling
- Charged state normalization
- Lipid nomenclature chaos
- Database version inconsistencies
- Tautomer recognition

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Protein Mapping (Current)
- Direct match: 65-70%
- After normalization: 76%
- After all stages: 85-88%
- Unmappable: 12-15%

### Metabolite Mapping (Expected)
- Direct match: 45-55%
- After CTS: 75-80%
- After semantic: 85-88%
- Unmappable: 15-20%

## 🎬 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. [ ] Distribute parallel work packages to 3 Claude instances
2. [ ] Begin composite identifier implementation
3. [ ] Start HTML report template development
4. [ ] Initialize visualization functions

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. [ ] Integration test v2.1 strategy with production data
2. [ ] Complete reporting and visualization
3. [ ] Begin metabolite strategy development
4. [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. [ ] Full production deployment
2. [ ] Complete metabolite mapping strategies
3. [ ] Clinical chemistry (LOINC) integration
4. [ ] Multi-entity comprehensive strategies

## 🚨 Critical Risks

1. **Composite Identifiers** - Blocking production use
2. **API Rate Limits** - Could slow metabolite mapping
3. **Memory Usage** - Large datasets need chunking
4. **Context Compatibility** - Ongoing complexity

## 📝 Documentation Status

### Completed ✅
- Protein mapping context document
- Metabolite mapping handoff
- TDD methodology guide
- Parallel work prompts
- Architecture decisions

### Needed 📌
- API integration guide
- Performance tuning guide
- Production deployment checklist
- User documentation

## 🤝 Team Coordination

### Communication Channels
- Progress updates: Update this document
- Blockers: Create `BLOCKERS.md` in same directory
- Questions: Document in action's directory

### Code Review Protocol
1. All PRs require tests
2. Coverage must not decrease
3. Type checking must pass
4. Linting must pass

## 💡 Key Insights

### What We've Learned
1. **Context is Everything** - The context handling issue consumed 60% of debug time
2. **TDD Saves Time** - Despite upfront cost, prevents rework
3. **Metabolites are Messier** - More ambiguity than proteins
4. **Progressive Matching Works** - Multiple fallback strategies essential
5. **Track Everything** - Statistics and provenance crucial for trust

### What We'd Do Differently
1. Start with simpler context model
2. Build composite identifier handling from day 1
3. Implement caching earlier
4. Create visualization as we go
5. Document parameter names religiously
