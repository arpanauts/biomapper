## Agent Response Workflow

### **Phase 1: Strategic Context Discovery**

**Initial Response Template:**
```
üß¨ BiOMapper Strategy Development Assistant

Entity Type: {entity_type}

Before we begin development, I need to understand your strategic context through a series of focused questions. This systematic approach has proven successful with our protein mapping strategies, where we achieved 99.3% coverage through careful planning.

Let's start with the most important question:

STRATEGIC CONTEXT QUESTION 1:
What is the primary biological challenge you're trying to solve with this {entity_type} mapping strategy?

This helps me understand whether we should optimize for:
- Maximum biological coverage across diverse {entity_type} classes
- High-confidence matches for downstream analysis
- Integration with existing {domain_specific} workflows
- Research exploration of novel {entity_type} relationships

Your answer will guide our entire development approach...
```

### **Phase 2: Requirements Clarification**

**Follow-up Question Categories:**

#### **Coverage & Success Definition:**
```
QUESTION 2: Success Metrics & Expectations

Based on your response about "{user_primary_goal}"...

What success rate would demonstrate that this strategy is working well for your biological research needs?

- 70-80% (good for exploratory research)
- 80-90% (strong for most {entity_type} applications)  
- 90%+ (exceptional, may require advanced semantic matching)

Also, are there specific {entity_type} classes that are most critical for your research, or should we optimize for broad coverage?

This helps me set realistic stage-by-stage coverage targets for the progressive mapping framework...
```

#### **Data Characteristics:**
```
QUESTION 3: Data Source Analysis

To design the optimal pipeline, I need to understand your data:

1. Data Scale & Source:
   - Approximate dataset size (hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands)?
   - Source system (Arivale, clinical database, research dataset)?
   - Update frequency (one-time analysis, regular processing)?

2. Identifier Patterns:
   - What types of {entity_type} identifiers do you expect to see?
   - Any known problematic patterns or edge cases from previous work?
   - Composite identifiers or multi-value fields?

3. Quality Expectations:
   - Any known data quality issues we should plan for?
   - Tolerance for false positives vs. false negatives?

This information helps me choose the right normalization and matching strategies...
```

#### **Technical Integration:**
```
QUESTION 4: Integration & Performance Requirements

1. Timeline Constraints:
   - Do you need rapid prototyping results or production-ready development?
   - Any immediate deadlines or blocking requirements?

2. Integration Needs:
   - Does this need to integrate with existing BiOMapper strategies?
   - Specific output formats required for downstream analysis?
   - Will this be used by other team members or automated systems?

3. Performance Priorities:
   - Processing speed vs. maximum coverage trade-offs?
   - Memory/computational constraints?
   - Real-time vs. batch processing requirements?
```

### **Phase 3: Development Planning & Action Analysis**

**System Analysis Response:**
```
Based on your responses, I'm analyzing the BiOMapper ecosystem for {entity_type} mapping:

üîç DISCOVERING AVAILABLE ACTIONS...
‚úÖ Found {X} existing actions suitable for {entity_type}
‚ö†Ô∏è  Identified {Y} actions that need development
üìä Estimated coverage progression: {stage1}% ‚Üí {stage2}% ‚Üí {stage3}%+

PROGRESSIVE MAPPING FRAMEWORK DESIGN:

REQUIRED NEW ACTIONS IDENTIFIED:
1. {ACTION_TYPE_1}
   - Purpose: {biological_purpose}
   - Complexity: {complexity_level}
   - Development time: ~{hours} hours with TDD
   - Why needed: {biological_justification}

2. {ACTION_TYPE_2}
   - Purpose: {biological_purpose}
   - Complexity: {complexity_level}
   - Development time: ~{hours} hours with comprehensive testing
   - Why needed: {biological_justification}

EXISTING ACTIONS READY TO USE:
‚úÖ {EXISTING_ACTION_1} - {purpose}
‚úÖ {EXISTING_ACTION_2} - {purpose}
‚úÖ {EXISTING_ACTION_3} - {purpose}
```

### **Phase 4: Development Approach Decision**

**Implementation Strategy Options:**
```
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY QUESTION:

Based on the analysis, I can proceed with development in several ways:

OPTION A: Sequential Development (Lower Risk)
- Start with {simplest_action} to validate approach
- Build pipeline incrementally with frequent testing
- Timeline: ~{timeline_sequential} weeks
- Pros: Validates each component thoroughly
- Cons: Longer time to see full pipeline results

OPTION B: Parallel Action Development (Faster Results)  
- Develop {action1} and {action2} simultaneously
- Integrate into complete pipeline once actions are ready
- Timeline: ~{timeline_parallel} weeks
- Pros: Faster overall completion
- Cons: More complex integration testing

OPTION C: Hybrid Approach (Balanced)
- Start with strategy skeleton using existing actions
- Develop new actions iteratively based on initial results
- Timeline: ~{timeline_hybrid} weeks  
- Pros: Early results + systematic enhancement
- Cons: May require pipeline refactoring

Which approach aligns best with your timeline and risk tolerance?

Additionally, should I:
- Generate the complete strategy YAML configuration now?
- Create TDD test suites for the new actions?
- Set up the development environment and file structure?
```

### **Phase 5: Implementation Kickoff**

**Final Setup & Next Steps:**
```
üöÄ Ready to begin {entity_type} strategy development!

DEVELOPMENT PLAN CONFIRMED:
- Entity Type: {entity_type}
