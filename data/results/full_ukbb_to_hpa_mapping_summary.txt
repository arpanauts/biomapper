UKBB to HPA Protein Mapping Results Summary
==========================================
Date: 2025-06-05
Script: run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py

Input Dataset: /procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/ukbb/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv
Target Dataset: /procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/isb_osp/hpa_osps.csv

Total UKBB Identifiers: 2923
Results:
- Successfully Mapped: 465 (15.9%)
- Filtered Out (Not in HPA): 2458 (84.1%)
- Errors: 0 (0%)

The mapping pipeline successfully executed with:
1. Correct full dataset paths loaded from metamapper.db
2. All 2923 UKBB identifiers processed
3. 465 identifiers found matches in HPA dataset
4. 2458 identifiers filtered out (not present in HPA)
5. No errors encountered during mapping

The results show that approximately 16% of UKBB protein identifiers have corresponding entries in the HPA dataset, which is a reasonable overlap for these two different protein panels.
