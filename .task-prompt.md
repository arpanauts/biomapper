# Task: Resolve RefMetClient Failures

## Context:
Numerous tests in `tests/mapping/clients/test_refmet_client.py` are failing with `AssertionError`. These failures suggest issues with the `RefMetClient`'s ability to correctly parse responses from the RefMet service, handle various data scenarios (empty responses, malformed data, API errors), transform data, or manage its internal state during these operations.

## Objective:
Debug and fix the `RefMetClient` to ensure it robustly handles API interactions, correctly processes data, and behaves as expected under various conditions tested.

## Affected Tests & Errors:
All failures are `AssertionError`s in `tests/mapping/clients/test_refmet_client.py`:

- `test_successful_search`
- `test_empty_response`
- `test_malformed_response`
- `test_name_cleaning`
- `test_pandas_error_handling`
- `test_request_exception`
- `test_empty_dataframe`
- `test_retry_mechanism`
- `test_http_error`
- `test_search_compounds_error`
- `test_search_by_name[glucose-Input name\tRefMet_ID\tStandardized name\tFormula\tExact mass\tINCHI_KEY\tPubChem_CID\tChEBI_ID\tHMDB_ID\tKEGG_ID\nglucose\tRM0135901\tGlucose\tC6H12O6\t180.0634\tWQZGKKKJIJFFOK-GASJEMHNSA-N\t5793\t4167\tHMDB0000122\tC00031\n-expected_result0]`
- `test_search_by_name_request_error`
- `test_search_by_name_complex_terms`

## Tasks:
1.  **Systematically Review Each Failing Test:** For each test listed above:
    *   Understand what specific scenario or functionality the test is targeting.
    *   Examine the `RefMetClient` code relevant to that test.
    *   Identify why the assertion is failing (e.g., incorrect data parsing, improper error handling, flawed data transformation logic).
2.  **Focus Areas for `RefMetClient` Debugging:**
    *   **API Response Parsing:** How does the client handle JSON or other formats from RefMet? Are all expected fields correctly extracted?
    *   **Data Cleaning/Standardization:** Is the `test_name_cleaning` failure indicative of broader issues in how client data is processed?
    *   **Error Handling:** How does the client manage HTTP errors, request exceptions, or unexpected API responses (empty, malformed)?
    *   **Pandas Integration:** If Pandas is used, are DataFrames created and manipulated correctly? How are Pandas-specific errors handled?
    *   **Retry Logic:** Is the retry mechanism functioning as intended?
    *   **Edge Cases:** Pay attention to tests covering empty or malformed responses, as these often reveal robustness issues.
3.  **Implement Fixes:** Correct the identified issues in `RefMetClient`.

## Expected Outcome:
All tests in `tests/mapping/clients/test_refmet_client.py` should pass, demonstrating that `RefMetClient` is reliable and handles various scenarios correctly.
