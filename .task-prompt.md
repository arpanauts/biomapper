## Task: Fix MappingPathExecutionService Tests

Fix the failing tests that are failing due to MappingPathExecutionService constructor signature changes.

### Problem
The MappingPathExecutionService class constructor was updated to require additional parameters, but the MappingExecutor initialization is still using the old constructor signature.

### Solution Required
1. Update MappingExecutor initialization to provide all required parameters to MappingPathExecutionService
2. Remove duplicate class definitions in mapping_path_execution_service.py
3. Ensure all tests pass
