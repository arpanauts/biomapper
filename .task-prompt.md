# Prompt: Consolidate and Complete Tests for Lifecycle Components

## Goal
Ensure the entire refactored lifecycle management subsystem has robust and complete test coverage. This involves reviewing existing tests for the decomposed services and creating new tests for the `LifecycleCoordinator`.

## Context
The old `LifecycleManager` was decomposed into three distinct services (`ExecutionSessionService`, `CheckpointService`, `ResourceDisposalService`) and a new `LifecycleCoordinator` facade that delegates to them. Feedback from a previous run indicated that some tests were created for the services, but the coordinator itself is untested, and the existing tests may be incomplete. This task is to solidify the testing for this entire critical subsystem.

## Requirements

1.  **Review and Enhance Existing Service Tests:**
    -   **File:** `tests/unit/core/services/test_checkpoint_service.py`
    -   **File:** `tests/unit/core/services/test_execution_session_service.py`
    -   **File:** `tests/unit/core/services/test_resource_disposal_service.py`
    -   **Action:** Carefully review the tests in these files. Ensure they are comprehensive, covering all public methods, edge cases, and both success and failure scenarios. Add or refactor tests as needed to achieve complete coverage.

2.  **Create Tests for `LifecycleCoordinator`:**
    -   **Create File:** `tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_lifecycle_coordinator.py`.
    -   **Logic:** The `LifecycleCoordinator` is a pure facade. The tests should reflect this.
    -   **Structure:**
        -   Create mock objects for the three underlying services (`ExecutionSessionService`, `CheckpointService`, `ResourceDisposalService`).
        -   Instantiate the `LifecycleCoordinator` with these mocks.
        -   For each public method in the coordinator (e.g., `save_checkpoint`, `dispose_resources`), write a test to verify that it correctly delegates the call to the appropriate mocked service with the correct arguments.

## Files to Modify
-   **Review/Modify:**
    -   `tests/unit/core/services/test_checkpoint_service.py`
    -   `tests/unit/core/services/test_execution_session_service.py`
    -   `tests/unit/core/services/test_resource_disposal_service.py`
-   **Create:**
    -   `tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_lifecycle_coordinator.py`

## Success Criteria
-   The three existing test files for the lifecycle services are reviewed and updated to be fully comprehensive.
-   A new, complete test suite for the `LifecycleCoordinator` is created and verifies all its delegations.
-   The entire lifecycle subsystem (coordinator and services) has robust, reliable, and complete test coverage.
-   All related tests pass when run with `pytest`.
