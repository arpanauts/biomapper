# Task: Refactor Placeholder Resolution to a Utility Function

## 1. Task Objective
To improve code organization, extract the logic for resolving placeholders (e.g., `${VAR}`) from `MappingExecutor` into a dedicated utility function.

## 2. Task Decomposition
1.  **Create New File:** Create `biomapper/core/utils/placeholder_resolver.py`.
2.  **Create `__init__.py`:** Ensure `biomapper/core/utils/__init__.py` exists.
3.  **Create Utility Function:** In the new file, create a function `resolve_placeholders(value: Any, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any`.
4.  **Move Logic:** Move the implementation from `MappingExecutor._resolve_placeholders` into the new `resolve_placeholders` function.
5.  **Update `MappingExecutor`:**
    *   Remove the `_resolve_placeholders` method.
    *   Add the import `from ..utils.placeholder_resolver import resolve_placeholders`.
    *   Update the call site within `execute_yaml_strategy` to use the new utility function.

## 3. Success Criteria
- [ ] `placeholder_resolver.py` is created with the `resolve_placeholders` function.
- [ ] The `_resolve_placeholders` method is removed from `MappingExecutor`.
- [ ] `MappingExecutor` correctly uses the new utility function, and placeholder resolution works as before.

## 4. Feedback Requirements
Create a feedback file confirming the refactoring was completed successfully.
