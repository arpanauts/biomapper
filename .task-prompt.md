# Task 4: Verify and Document `CompositeIdSplitter` Strategy Action

**Source Prompt Reference:** This task is part of recreating the legacy `UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE`.

## 1. Task Objective
Thoroughly review, test, and document the existing `CompositeIdSplitter` action to ensure it is robust, reliable, and ready for use in production strategies. This action is critical for handling UKBB data.

## 2. Service Architecture Context
- **Primary Service:** `biomapper` (core library)
- **Affected Module:** `biomapper.core.strategy_actions.composite_id_splitter`
- **Service Dependencies:** None.

## 3. Task Decomposition
1.  **Code Review:** Perform a detailed review of the implementation in `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/composite_id_splitter.py`. Check for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to project standards.
2.  **Enhance Unit Tests:** Review the existing unit tests in `tests/unit/strategy_actions/`. Add new tests to cover any missing edge cases, such as identifiers with no delimiter, multiple delimiters, or empty strings. Aim for 100% test coverage.
3.  **Validate Registration:** Confirm the action is registered as `COMPOSITE_ID_SPLITTER`.
4.  **Improve Documentation:** Update the docstring to be as clear as possible. Include a detailed explanation of all parameters and provide a copy-and-paste example for use in a YAML file.

## 4. Implementation Requirements
- **Action File:** `/home/trentleslie/github/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/composite_id_splitter.py`
- **Test File:** `/home/trentleslie/github/biomapper/tests/unit/strategy_actions/test_composite_id_splitter.py`
- The action must correctly handle provenance tracking.

## 5. Success Criteria and Validation
- [ ] The action has been peer-reviewed (simulated by you).
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 100% code coverage.
- [ ] The docstring is complete and includes a clear usage example.
- [ ] The action is confirmed to be robust and ready for production use.
