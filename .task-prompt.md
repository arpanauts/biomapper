# Task: Resolve Miscellaneous Remaining Test Failures

## Context:
A variety of tests across different modules are failing with diverse errors, including `AssertionError`, `SQLAlchemyError`, and issues with client initialization or setup. These errors don't fall into the larger categories previously defined but are crucial for overall system stability.

## Objective:
Address each of these miscellaneous test failures by debugging the specific components or functionalities they target.

## Affected Tests & Errors:

1.  **`tests/core/test_metadata_fields.py`**
    *   `test_cache_results_populates_metadata_fields` - `AssertionError: assert 'forward' == 'reverse'`
        *   **Focus:** Investigate how the `mapping_direction` metadata field is populated when results are cached. There's a mismatch between the expected and actual direction.
    *   `test_confidence_score_calculation` - `AssertionError: Expected ~0.8 but got 0.9 for {'hop_count': 2, 'is_reverse': False, 'expected_confidence': 0.8}`
        *   **Focus:** Review the confidence score calculation logic. The calculated score is not matching the expected score for the given parameters.

2.  **`tests/core/test_metadata_impl.py`**
    *   `test_cache_results_populates_metadata_fields` - `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Textual SQL expression 'DELETE FROM entity_mappin...' should be explicitly declared as text('DELETE FROM entity_mappin...')`
        *   **Focus:** This SQLAlchemy error indicates a raw SQL string is being used where SQLAlchemy expects a `text()` construct for safety. Locate the `DELETE` statement and wrap it appropriately (e.g., `text('DELETE ...')`).

3.  **`tests/embedder/storage/test_vector_store.py`**
    *   `TestFAISSVectorStore::test_ivf_index_type` - `AssertionError: assert 1 == 5`
        *   **Focus:** Examine the FAISS IVF index setup or property check. The assertion indicates a mismatch in an expected numeric value, possibly related to index parameters or counts.

4.  **`tests/mapping/clients/test_umls_client.py`**
    *   `test_init` - `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'biomapper.core.exceptions.ClientInitializationError'>`
        *   **Focus:** The test expects `ClientInitializationError` to be raised during `UMLSClient` initialization under certain (likely error) conditions, but it's not. Review the `UMLSClient` constructor's error handling.

5.  **`tests/mapping/rag/test_rag_setup.py`**
    *   `test_rag_initialization` - `assert None is not None`
        *   **Focus:** This suggests that a component or variable expected to be initialized (not `None`) during RAG setup is remaining `None`. Check the RAG initialization sequence.

6.  **`tests/unit/core/test_path_finder.py`**
    *   `TestPathFinder::test_find_paths_for_relationship_database_error` - `sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError: Database error`
        *   **Focus:** The test is likely designed to check how `PathFinder` handles database errors during path finding. The error itself is generic; the task is to ensure `PathFinder` catches and handles this (or specific SQLAlchemy errors) gracefully, possibly by raising a custom application exception.

## Tasks:
For each affected test:
1.  Understand the specific functionality or scenario being tested.
2.  Isolate the cause of the error within the relevant module/class.
3.  Implement the necessary corrections.

## Expected Outcome:
All listed miscellaneous tests should pass, improving the overall stability and correctness of various smaller components and functionalities.
