# Task: Resolve Cache & Metadata Database Issues (SQLite & SQLAlchemy 2.0)
# Task: Resolve Integration & Strategy Orchestration Issues

## Objective
Fix SQLite operational errors related to missing tables (specifically `entity_mappings`) and address SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility issues for raw SQL queries in tests related to caching and metadata.
Address `ModuleNotFoundError` for `scripts.populate_metamapper_db` in integration tests and fix `TypeError`s related to asynchronous context managers in `StrategyOrchestrator` tests.

## Affected Files/Modules
- `tests/cache/test_cached_mapper.py`
- `tests/cache/test_manager.py`
- `tests/core/test_metadata_fields.py`
- `tests/core/test_metadata_impl.py`

## Common Error(s)
- `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: entity_mappings`
- `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Textual SQL expression 'DELETE FROM entity_mappin...' should be explicitly declared as text('DELETE FROM e...')`

## Background/Context
The `entity_mappings` table, crucial for caching, appears to be missing or inaccessible during certain test executions. This could be due to issues with test database setup, schema creation, or session management within the tests.

Additionally, SQLAlchemy 2.0 has enforced stricter handling of raw SQL strings. Queries executed directly (not through the ORM's expression language) must now be explicitly wrapped with `text()` to be recognized as SQL statements.

## Debugging Guidance/Hypotheses

**For `no such table: entity_mappings`:**
- **Test Database Setup:** Verify how the test database is initialized. Is it an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`) or a file-based one? Ensure consistency.
- **Schema Creation:** Confirm that `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` (or its async equivalent) is called correctly before tests that interact with the database are run. This is essential for creating all defined tables.
- **Session Scope:** Check if test sessions are correctly scoped and if schema creation happens within the right context for the test's session to see the tables.
- **Fixtures:** Review pytest fixtures responsible for database setup (e.g., `engine`, `session` fixtures) to ensure they correctly set up and tear down the database environment, including table creation.

**For `ArgumentError: Textual SQL expression ... should be explicitly declared as text(...)`:**
- **Import `text`:** Ensure `from sqlalchemy import text` is present in the relevant files.
- **Wrap SQL Strings:** Locate all raw SQL strings used in functions like `session.execute()` and wrap them with the `text()` construct. For example, `session.execute("DELETE FROM entity_mappings")` should become `session.execute(text("DELETE FROM entity_mappings"))`.

## Specific Error Examples
1.  `FAILED tests/cache/test_cached_mapper.py::CachedMapperTest::test_batch_map_mixed_hits - sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: entity_mappings`
2.  `FAILED tests/cache/test_manager.py::CacheManagerTest::test_add_mapping - sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: entity_mappings`
3.  `FAILED tests/core/test_metadata_fields.py::test_cache_results_populates_metadata_fields - sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Textual SQL expression 'DELETE FROM entity_mappin...' should be explicitly declared as text('DELETE FROM e...')`
## Affected Files/Modules
- `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`
- `tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py`

## Common Error(s)
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts.populate_metamapper_db'`
- `TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`

## Background/Context
**ModuleNotFoundError:**
The `scripts` directory, containing `populate_metamapper_db.py`, is not currently configured as a Python package (it lacks `__init__.py` files). This prevents direct import of the script as a module in the integration tests. The script is likely intended to be run as a command-line tool.

**TypeError with Async Context Managers:**
Tests for `StrategyOrchestrator` are failing with `TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`. This typically occurs when an `async def` function that is *not* a proper asynchronous context manager is used with `async with`. An asynchronous context manager requires `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods, or to be a generator decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` from `contextlib`.

## Debugging Guidance/Hypotheses

**For `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts.populate_metamapper_db'`:**
- **Option 1 (Recommended for scripts): Run as Subprocess:** Modify the integration tests to execute `populate_metamapper_db.py` using `subprocess.run()` or `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`. This aligns with how standalone scripts are typically invoked and tested. Remember that the script auto-discovers configs and takes `--drop-all` (Memory `[631e6476-8513-4727-aa46-494041b7b79b]`).
- **Option 2 (Make `scripts` a package):** Add empty `__init__.py` files to `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/` and `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/setup_and_configuration/`. This would allow imports like `from scripts.setup_and_configuration import populate_metamapper_db`. Ensure the project root is in `sys.path` (Poetry usually handles this).
- **Investigate Test Setup:** See how `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` attempts to use or invoke the script. The fix will depend on this current approach.

**For `TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`:**
- **Review Async Context Managers:** Examine the objects being used with `async with` in `tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py`. 
- **Check for `@asynccontextmanager`:** If the object is an async generator function intended for context management, ensure it's decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` from the `contextlib` module and uses `yield` appropriately.
- **Verify `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`:** If it's a class, ensure it correctly implements the `async def __aenter__(self):` and `async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):` methods.
- **Mocking:** If mocks are involved, ensure the mock object is configured to behave like a proper async context manager (e.g., its `__aenter__` returns an awaitable, or the mock itself is an `AsyncMock` configured appropriately).

## Specific Error Examples
1.  `ERROR tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py::TestYAMLStrategyExecution::test_basic_linear_strategy - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts.populate_metamapper_db'`
2.  `FAILED tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py::TestStrategyOrchestrator::test_successful_strategy_execution - TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`
3.  `FAILED tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py::TestStrategyOrchestrator::test_strategy_failure_required_step - TypeError: 'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol`

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests in the listed 'Affected Files/Modules' that previously failed with `OperationalError: no such table: entity_mappings` now pass, indicating the `entity_mappings` table is correctly created and accessible.
- All tests that previously failed with `ArgumentError: Textual SQL expression ... should be explicitly declared as text(...)` now pass, with raw SQL queries correctly adapted for SQLAlchemy 2.0.
- Database interactions within these tests are robust and schema is correctly managed.
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` can successfully invoke or utilize the `populate_metamapper_db.py` script, resolving the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- All tests in `tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py` pass, with `TypeError`s related to async context managers resolved.
- The chosen solution for the `ModuleNotFoundError` is robust and aligns with good testing practices for scripts.
- Asynchronous context managers are correctly implemented and used in the strategy orchestrator tests.
