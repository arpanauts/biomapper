# Task 1: Refactor Core MappingExecutor Unit Tests
# Task 5: Review and Refactor PathFinder Service Tests
# Task 2: Refactor Bidirectional Mapping Optimization Tests

## 1. Objective

Refactor the core unit tests for `MappingExecutor` that are currently failing or skipped due to the recent service-oriented architecture refactoring. The goal is to decouple these tests from the `MappingExecutor`'s internal implementation and instead test the new, focused service classes (`StrategyExecutionService`, `PathFinder`, `ConfigLoader`, etc.) directly or test `MappingExecutor` as a high-level orchestrator using dependency injection.
Review and refactor the unit tests for the `PathFinder` service, located in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/engine_components/test_path_finder.py`. The goal is to ensure the tests are robust, maintainable, and focused on the service's public contract, not its internal implementation details.
Refactor the tests within `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/test_bidirectional_mapping_optimization.py`. These tests are currently skipped or failing because they are tightly coupled to the previous implementation of `MappingExecutor` and its internal methods.

## 2. Context and Background

The `MappingExecutor` was recently refactored from a large, monolithic class into a lean orchestrator that delegates tasks to specialized service classes. This has broken numerous unit tests that were tightly coupled to its old internal methods (e.g., `_run_path_steps`, `_get_path_from_cache`). This task is to update these tests to reflect the new architecture, ensuring our test suite is robust and maintainable.
The previous test-fixing effort noted that `test_path_caching` was failing in other files because path caching is now an internal responsibility of the `PathFinder` service. This highlights the need to ensure that `PathFinder` itself has strong tests for this behavior. This task is a proactive measure to review the existing tests for `PathFinder` and improve them according to best practices.
The `test_bidirectional_mapping_optimization.py` file contains critical tests for complex logic, including path caching, concurrent processing, and metrics tracking. The recent refactoring of `MappingExecutor` into a service-oriented architecture has broken these tests. The feedback from the previous test-fixing task specifically called out `test_path_caching`, `test_concurrent_batch_processing`, and `test_metrics_tracking` as needing a complete rewrite.

## 3. Prerequisites

- The agent must understand the new service-oriented architecture and the roles of classes like `StrategyExecutionService`, `PathFinder`, `IdentifierLoader`, and `ConfigLoader`.
- A clear understanding of the `PathFinder` service's role: to discover and cache paths between ontology types in the mapping graph.
- Strong knowledge of testing principles, especially testing behavior vs. implementation.
- The agent must have a deep understanding of the bidirectional mapping strategy and how it's orchestrated by the new services.
- Familiarity with `PathFinder` (for caching), `StrategyExecutionService` (for orchestration), and `MetricsService` (if applicable, or where metrics logic now resides) is essential.

## 4. Task Breakdown

For each of the files below, perform the following steps:

1.  **Analyze Existing Tests:** Identify why each test is failing. Most failures will be due to `AttributeError` for methods that no longer exist.
2.  **Determine the New Target:** Decide what the test *should* be testing in the new architecture. Is it testing logic now in `PathFinder`? Or `StrategyExecutionService`? Or is it a high-level integration test of `MappingExecutor`?
3.  **Rewrite the Test:**
    - If testing a service, write a new test file for that service (if one doesn't exist) or add to an existing one. Use mocking (`unittest.mock`) to isolate the service from its dependencies (e.g., database sessions, other services).
    - If testing `MappingExecutor`'s orchestration logic, mock the service-level dependencies that are passed into its constructor and assert that the correct service methods are called with the expected parameters.
4.  **Delete Old Test:** Once the logic is covered by a new, robust test, delete the old, failing test.

### Target Files:

- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor_metadata.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor_robust_features.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor_utilities.py`
1.  **Review Existing Tests:** Read through all tests in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/engine_components/test_path_finder.py`.

2.  **Identify Tightly-Coupled Tests:** Look for tests that:
    - Mock internal, private methods of `PathFinder`.
    - Make assumptions about the internal data structures used for caching.
    - Are difficult to read or understand.

3.  **Refactor for Behavioral Testing:**
    - **Path Caching:** Ensure there is a clear behavioral test for caching. This test should *not* inspect the cache object directly. Instead, it should:
        a. Mock the database session dependency.
        b. Call `path_finder.find_path(...)` once.
        c. Assert that the database was called.
        d. Call `path_finder.find_path(...)` a second time with the *exact same parameters*.
        e. Assert that the database was **not** called the second time.
        f. Call `path_finder.find_path(...)` a third time with *different* parameters.
        g. Assert that the database **was** called the third time.
    - **Path Finding Logic:** Ensure tests cover various scenarios: direct paths, multi-step paths, no paths found, etc. These tests should focus on the input (source/target types) and the output (the returned path or lack thereof).

4.  **Improve Readability and Maintainability:**
    - Use clear and descriptive test names.
    - Add comments where the test logic is complex.
    - Refactor any convoluted test setups to be simpler.
1.  **Analyze `test_path_caching`:**
    - This test likely checked the internal cache of `MappingExecutor`. Path caching is now handled by `PathFinder`.
    - **Action:** Rewrite this test to target the `PathFinder` service directly. Mock its database dependency and verify that calling `find_path` multiple times with the same parameters results in a cache hit (i.e., the database is only queried once).

2.  **Analyze `test_concurrent_batch_processing`:**
    - This test likely used the old `_run_path_steps` method. Concurrent logic is now managed within services.
    - **Action:** Rewrite this test to target the relevant service (likely `StrategyExecutionService` or a batch processing service it uses). The test should verify that when given a large list of identifiers, the service correctly processes them in concurrent batches.

3.  **Analyze `test_metrics_tracking`:**
    - This test checked internal metrics counters in `MappingExecutor`.
    - **Action:** Determine where metrics logic now resides. It might be in a dedicated `MetricsService` or within the `execution_context` passed between strategy actions. Rewrite the test to verify that metrics (e.g., 'mapped_count', 'unmapped_count') are correctly tracked and reported after a mapping run.

4.  **Review and Refactor Other Tests:** Go through any other tests in the file and apply the same principles: identify the new location of the logic and rewrite the test to target the correct service, using mocking and dependency injection.

## 5. Implementation Requirements

- **Code Standards:** Follow existing code style, use `pytest` conventions, and leverage `unittest.mock` for mocking. All new tests must be asynchronous (`async def`).
- **Dependency Injection:** Heavily rely on dependency injection to make tests clean and isolated.
- **Target File:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/engine_components/test_path_finder.py`
- **Code Standards:** Use `pytest` and `unittest.mock`. All tests must be `async def`.
- **Principle:** Test the what, not the how. The tests should validate the public contract of `PathFinder` so that its internal implementation can be changed in the future without breaking the tests.
