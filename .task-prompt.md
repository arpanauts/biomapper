# Task: Move Strategy Execution Loop to StrategyOrchestrator

## 1. Task Objective
This is a major refactoring step. The goal is to move the core strategy execution loop from `MappingExecutor` to `StrategyOrchestrator`, making the executor a thin facade and the orchestrator the true engine for running strategies.

## 2. Task Decomposition
1.  **Modify `StrategyOrchestrator.__init__`:** Update its constructor to accept instances of the components it will need to delegate to, such as `action_executor`, and a `logger`.
2.  **Create `StrategyOrchestrator.execute`:** Create a new public method, `async def execute(self, strategy: Dict, execution_context: Dict) -> Dict:`.
3.  **Move Execution Loop:** Move the main `for step in strategy['steps']:` loop and all of its internal logic from `MappingExecutor.execute_yaml_strategy` into the new `StrategyOrchestrator.execute` method. This includes:
    *   Managing and updating the `execution_context`.
    *   Resolving placeholders for step parameters.
    *   Calling the `ActionExecutor` to run each action.
    *   Handling step-level error logging and status updates.
4.  **Refactor `MappingExecutor.execute_yaml_strategy`:** Simplify this method to be a high-level wrapper. Its new responsibilities are:
    *   Loading the strategy definition using `StrategyHandler`.
    *   Initializing the top-level `execution_context`.
    *   Calling `self.strategy_orchestrator.execute(strategy, execution_context)`.
    *   Handling the final result and returning it.
5.  **Update `MappingExecutor.__init__`:** Ensure `StrategyOrchestrator` is instantiated with its new dependencies.

## 3. Success Criteria
- [ ] The main execution loop is removed from `MappingExecutor.execute_yaml_strategy`.
- [ ] `StrategyOrchestrator.execute` contains the full loop and step-execution logic.
- [ ] `MappingExecutor` correctly initializes and calls the `StrategyOrchestrator`.
- [ ] End-to-end strategy execution remains fully functional.

## 4. Feedback Requirements
Create a feedback file confirming this significant refactoring was completed successfully.
