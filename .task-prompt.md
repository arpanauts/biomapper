# Task: Fix Failing Path Execution Tests in `test_mapping_executor.py`

## Task Objective

Your task is to fix four failing tests in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` related to path execution. The tests are: `test_run_path_steps_basic`, `test_run_path_steps_multi_step`, `test_run_path_steps_one_to_many`, and `test_run_path_steps_error_handling`. The goal is to ensure these tests pass successfully.

## Prerequisites

-   You have access to the `biomapper` codebase at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/`.
-   Poetry environment is set up and dependencies are installed.

## Input Context

-   **Failing Test File:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`
-   **File Under Test:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` (specifically the `execute_path` method)
-   **Pytest Output Snippet:**

    ```
    FAILED tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py::test_run_path_steps_basic - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
    FAILED tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py::test_run_path_steps_multi_step - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
    FAILED tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py::test_run_path_steps_one_to_many - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
    FAILED tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py::test_run_path_steps_error_handling - Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'biomapper.core.exce...
    ```

-   **Failing Test Code (in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`):**

    -   `test_run_path_steps_basic` (starts line 1487)
    -   `test_run_path_steps_multi_step` (starts line 1531)
    -   `test_run_path_steps_one_to_many` (starts line 1594)
    -   `test_run_path_steps_error_handling` (starts line 1663)

## Expected Outputs

-   Modified `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` to correctly handle results and errors within the `execute_path` method.
-   The four specified tests should run without errors.

## Success Criteria

-   Running the command `poetry run pytest /home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` shows that the four `test_run_path_steps_*` tests now pass. Other test results should remain unaffected.

## Error Recovery Instructions

-   If the fix requires significant architectural changes to the `PathExecutionManager`, document the proposed changes and report back before implementing.

## Environment Requirements

-   A working `poetry` environment for the `biomapper` project.
-   Access to the project files.

## Task Decomposition

1.  **Analyze the `TypeError`:**
    -   The `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in the three `test_run_path_steps_*` tests suggests that a variable expected to be a list or other iterable is `None`. This is likely happening during result aggregation within the `execute_path` method in `path_execution_manager.py`.
    -   Trace the flow of data within `execute_path` to identify where the `None` value is introduced. It could be an unhandled case when a client returns no results.

2.  **Analyze the `test_run_path_steps_error_handling` Failure:**
    -   This test expects a `MappingExecutionError` to be raised when a client fails, but it's not. This indicates that the error handling logic within `execute_path` is either not catching the error correctly or not re-raising it as the expected exception type.
    -   Review the error handling blocks (e.g., `try...except`) within the `execute_path` method to ensure exceptions from client calls are caught and wrapped in a `MappingExecutionError`.

3.  **Implement Fixes:**
    -   Modify `path_execution_manager.py` to correctly initialize result variables (e.g., to an empty list instead of `None`).
    -   Adjust the error handling to ensure `MappingExecutionError` is raised with the appropriate details when a client fails.

4.  **Validate Fixes:**
    -   Run `poetry run pytest /home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` and confirm the four tests pass.

## Validation Checkpoints

-   After addressing the `TypeError`, run the first three tests to confirm they pass.
-   After addressing the error handling, run the `test_run_path_steps_error_handling` test to confirm it passes.
-   Before finishing, run the full test suite for `test_mapping_executor.py` to ensure no regressions were introduced.
