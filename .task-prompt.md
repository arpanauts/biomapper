# Task: Refactor Checkpointing Logic into CheckpointManager

## 1. Task Objective
To centralize state management, extract all checkpoint-related logic from `MappingExecutor` into a new `CheckpointManager` component.

## 2. Task Decomposition
1.  **Create New File:** Create `biomapper/core/engine_components/checkpoint_manager.py`.
2.  **Create `CheckpointManager` Class:** Inside the new file, create a `CheckpointManager` class.
3.  **Configure `__init__`:** The constructor should accept `checkpoint_dir` and a `logger`.
4.  **Move Logic:** Move the `_save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`, and `clear_checkpoint` methods from `MappingExecutor` to `CheckpointManager`. Make them public methods (e.g., `save_checkpoint`).
5.  **Update `MappingExecutor`:**
    *   In `__init__`, instantiate `self.checkpoint_manager = CheckpointManager(checkpoint_dir=self.checkpoint_dir, logger=self.logger)`.
    *   Remove the original checkpoint methods from `MappingExecutor`.
    *   Update the `execute_robust_yaml_strategy` method (and any other relevant methods) to call the new `self.checkpoint_manager` methods.

## 3. Success Criteria
- [ ] `checkpoint_manager.py` is created with the `CheckpointManager` class.
- [ ] Checkpointing methods are removed from `MappingExecutor`.
- [ ] `MappingExecutor` successfully uses the new `CheckpointManager`.
- [ ] Checkpointing functionality remains intact, and all related tests pass.

## 4. Feedback Requirements
Create a feedback file confirming the refactoring was completed successfully.
