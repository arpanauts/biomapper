# Task: Consolidate Path Logic into PathFinder

## 1. Task Objective
To centralize all path-finding and path-retrieval logic, move the `_get_path_details` method from `MappingExecutor` into the existing `PathFinder` component.

## 2. Task Decomposition
1.  **Identify Logic:** The `_get_path_details` method in `MappingExecutor` contains database query logic to fetch the full details of a mapping path.
2.  **Move Method:** Move this method into the `biomapper/core/engine_components/path_finder.py` file, making it a public method of the `PathFinder` class: `async def get_path_details(...)`.
3.  **Update `MappingExecutor`:**
    *   Remove the `_get_path_details` method.
    *   Update the call site within `execute_mapping_path` to use `self.path_finder.get_path_details(...)`.

## 3. Success Criteria
- [ ] The `get_path_details` method now resides in `PathFinder`.
- [ ] The `_get_path_details` method is removed from `MappingExecutor`.
- [ ] `MappingExecutor` correctly calls the method on `PathFinder` to retrieve path details.

## 4. Feedback Requirements
Create a feedback file confirming the refactoring was completed successfully.
