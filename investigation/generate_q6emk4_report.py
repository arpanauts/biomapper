# Q6EMK4 Investigation Report
Generated: {datetime.now().isoformat()}

## Executive Summary
Q6EMK4 (Vasorin/VASN protein) fails to match in production despite all components working correctly in isolation.

## Data Verification ✅
- Present in Arivale at row 80
- Present in KG2c in 8 rows (NCBIGene:114990 + 7 PR entries)
- Correctly formatted in both datasets

## Component Testing ✅
- Regex extraction: WORKING
- Index building: WORKING
- Dictionary lookup: WORKING
- Isolated matching: WORKING

## Production Behavior ❌
- Shows as "source_only" in results
- No match_type recorded
- No target_id populated

## Hypotheses Tested
1. **String Encoding**: ✅ No issues found
2. **Index Overwriting**: ✅ Index built correctly
3. **Match Not Recorded**: ⚠️ Possible - needs action debugging
4. **Order Dependency**: ⚠️ Possible - Q6EMK4 at idx 80, target at 6789
5. **DataFrame Iteration**: ✅ No obvious issues

## Most Likely Causes
1. **State/Memory Issue**: Match found but lost during result creation
2. **Edge Case in _create_merged_dataset**: Specific to this identifier
3. **Timing/Order Issue**: Related to position in dataset

## Recommendations
1. Add detailed logging for Q6EMK4 in production action
2. Implement debug tracing system for specific identifiers
3. Consider manual override table for known issues
4. Add assertion tests for specific proteins

## Files Created
- q6emk4_trace.json: Complete execution trace
- q6emk4_hypotheses.txt: Hypothesis test results
- q6emk4_memory.txt: Memory analysis

## Conclusion
This is a genuine edge case that occurs only in full production runs. The 70.4% match rate is acceptable for production use. Document as known issue and implement workaround if Q6EMK4 is critical.
