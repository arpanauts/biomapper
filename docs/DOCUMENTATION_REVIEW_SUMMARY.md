# Biomapper Documentation Review Summary

## Executive Summary

A systematic review of the Biomapper documentation revealed significant discrepancies between documentation and implementation, missing documentation for key features, and consistency issues across different documents. While the codebase has evolved substantially, the documentation has not kept pace, creating potential confusion for users and developers.

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Architecture Documentation Completely Outdated
- **mapping_executor_architecture.md**: Describes an old database-driven architecture that no longer exists
- **enhanced_mapping_executor.md**: Claims features were integrated into MappingExecutor but they use a different pattern
- Current facade-based architecture with coordinator services is not properly documented
- Missing documentation for MappingExecutorBuilder pattern and service dependencies

### 2. No REST API Documentation
- Biomapper-api service has no comprehensive API documentation
- Only external API documentation exists (for UniProt, ChEBI, etc.)
- Missing request/response examples, authentication details, error codes
- No static OpenAPI specification committed to repository

### 3. Major Discrepancies in User Documentation
- **usage.rst**: Shows synchronous API that doesn't exist (actual API is async)
- **getting_started.md**: References non-existent classes and shows pip installation
- Missing CLI command reference despite rich CLI functionality

### 4. Broken Code Examples
- Import paths incorrect in multiple tutorials
- Non-existent classes referenced (MetaboliteNameMapper, etc.)
- Missing test scripts referenced in documentation
- Empty placeholder tutorials (protein.md, llm_mapper.md)

## Key Findings by Category

### Architecture & Design
- ❌ Core architecture documents describe outdated patterns
- ❌ Missing documentation for current service-oriented architecture
- ❌ Action registry system not properly documented
- ✅ YAML strategy design well documented

### Installation & Setup
- ⚠️ Python version inconsistencies (3.10+ vs 3.11 requirement)
- ⚠️ Missing system dependencies for ChromaDB
- ❌ biomapper-api README uses pip instead of Poetry
- ✅ CLAUDE.md setup instructions are accurate

### API Documentation
- ❌ No documentation for biomapper-api REST endpoints
- ❌ Missing authentication/session management docs
- ✅ External API documentation comprehensive
- ✅ FastAPI auto-generates runtime docs

### User Guides & Tutorials
- ❌ Main usage guide shows incorrect synchronous API
- ❌ Several tutorials are empty placeholders
- ✅ CSV adapter tutorial is comprehensive and accurate
- ✅ Name resolution tutorials are well-written

### Developer Documentation
- ✅ CLAUDE.md is accurate and comprehensive
- ✅ LLM development guides are excellent
- ⚠️ Some contribution guides reference old architecture
- ❌ Missing database schema documentation

### Configuration & Standards
- ✅ YAML naming conventions well documented
- ⚠️ Proposed directory structure not implemented
- ❌ Missing validation script referenced in migration guide

## Consistency Issues

1. **Naming**: "Biomapper" vs "biomapper" used inconsistently
2. **Commands**: Some docs use `poetry run`, others don't
3. **Paths**: Inconsistent directory references
4. **Components**: Different names for same components across docs
5. **Examples**: Mix of sync/async patterns without clear guidance

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Rewrite architecture documentation** to reflect current facade pattern
2. **Create comprehensive REST API documentation**
3. **Fix usage.rst** to show correct async patterns
4. **Update all code examples** with correct imports
5. **Create CLI command reference**

### Medium Priority
6. **Standardize naming conventions** across all docs
7. **Complete or remove empty tutorials**
8. **Update installation guides** for consistency
9. **Document database schema and migrations**
10. **Fix biomapper-api README** to use Poetry

### Low Priority
11. **Implement proposed directory structure** for strategies
12. **Create missing validation scripts** or remove references
13. **Add visual documentation** (diagrams, screenshots)
14. **Cross-reference cleanup** between documents

## Positive Findings

- CLAUDE.md is an excellent, accurate development guide
- LLM prompt templates are comprehensive
- YAML strategy documentation is clear
- Some tutorials (CSV adapter, name resolution) are excellent
- Code style and testing guidelines are well-defined

## Impact Assessment

The current documentation state could:
- Frustrate new users trying incorrect examples
- Slow developer onboarding
- Lead to incorrect API usage
- Cause confusion about project architecture

However, the strong foundation in CLAUDE.md and clear patterns in the codebase make updates feasible.

## Next Steps

1. Create a documentation update project with clear priorities
2. Establish documentation standards guide
3. Set up automated checks for code example validity
4. Consider documentation generation from code where possible
5. Regular documentation review cycles
