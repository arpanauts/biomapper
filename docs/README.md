## LLM Agent Commands

Specialized agent modes are available via:
- `/home/ubuntu/.claude/commands/action-type-agent.md` - Enter action development mode
- `/home/ubuntu/.claude/commands/mapping-strategy-agent.md` - Enter strategy development mode

These commands configure the LLM to provide focused assistance for specific biomapper development tasks.
