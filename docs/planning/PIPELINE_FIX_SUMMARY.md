# Metabolomics Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issues Discovered

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Client Execution Issue
**Problem**: BiomapperClient was reporting success without executing strategies
**Root Cause**: Endpoint mismatch (`/api/mapping/jobs/` vs `/api/strategies/v2/jobs/`)
**Fix Applied**: Updated client to use correct v2 endpoints with v1 fallback

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Context Parameter Passing
**Problem**: API expected parameters wrapped in context structure
**Fix Applied**: Changed `context=parameters` to `context={"parameters": parameters}`

### 3. ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED: TypedStrategyAction Interface Issues
**Problem**: Mixed signatures for `execute_typed()` method
- Old signature: `execute_typed(current_identifiers, ontology, params, source, target, context)`
- New signature: `execute_typed(params, context)`

**Fix Applied**: Modified TypedStrategyAction.execute() to detect signature and call appropriately
**Status**: Base class fixed, but individual actions still have issues

### 4. ❌ NOT FIXED: Context Type Mismatch
**Problem**: Actions expect dict context but receive StrategyExecutionContext object
**Examples**:
- `fuzzy_string_match.py`: Uses `context.get("datasets", {})`
- `rampdb_bridge.py`: Uses `context.get()` pattern
- These fail with: `'StrategyExecutionContext' object has no attribute 'get'`

### 5. ❌ NOT FIXED: YAML Conditions Ignored
**Problem**: All stages run regardless of `stages_to_run` parameter
**Evidence**: Stage 2-4 actions execute even when `stages_to_run: [1]`
**Root Cause**: `condition:` fields in YAML are not evaluated by MinimalStrategyService

## Current Pipeline Status

| Stage | Action | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Stage 1 | METABOLITE_NIGHTINGALE_BRIDGE | ✅ Works | Full signature, handles both contexts |
| Stage 2 | METABOLITE_FUZZY_STRING_MATCH | ❌ Fails | Expects dict context, gets object |
| Stage 3 | METABOLITE_RAMPDB_BRIDGE | ❌ Fails | Expects dict context, gets object |
| Stage 4 | HMDB_VECTOR_MATCH | ❌ Fails | Qdrant collection missing + context issues |

## Actual Coverage
- **Stage 1 Only**: 15.2% (38/250 metabolites)
- **Stages 2-4**: Cannot measure due to execution failures
- **Total Achieved**: 15.2% (not 77.9% claimed)

## Fix Strategy

### Option A: Fix Each Action (Current Approach)
**Status**: Attempted but complex due to multiple issues
**Problems**: 
- Need to handle both dict and object contexts
- Different signature patterns
- Maintenance burden

### Option B: Universal Context Wrapper (Recommended)
**Approach**: Create a context wrapper that works like both dict and object
```python
class UniversalContext:
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        # Works for dict-style access
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        # Works for bracket access
    # Also has object attributes
```

### Option C: Standardize All Actions
**Approach**: Update all actions to use same signature and context handling
**Effort**: High - need to modify 20+ actions
**Benefit**: Long-term consistency

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create UniversalContext wrapper** to handle both dict and object patterns
2. **Fix MinimalStrategyService** to respect YAML conditions
3. **Setup Qdrant** for Stage 4 vector matching
4. **Test each stage independently** after fixes
5. **Measure real cumulative coverage**

## Expected Timeline

- **Week 1**: Fix context handling and conditions
- **Week 2**: Test and validate each stage
- **Week 3**: Measure real coverage
- **Week 4**: Decide on Stage 5 LIPID MAPS based on actual gaps

## Key Insight

The pipeline architecture has fundamental issues beyond simple parameter mismatches. The mixing of dict-based and object-based contexts, combined with ignored YAML conditions and inconsistent action signatures, creates a fragile system. A comprehensive fix focusing on standardization and robust context handling is needed before adding more stages.
