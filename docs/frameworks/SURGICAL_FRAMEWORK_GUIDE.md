# BiOMapper Surgical Framework Guide

## Overview

The Surgical Framework enables safe, isolated modifications to BiOMapper action internals without affecting pipeline integration or output structures. It's designed to be **automatically activated by agents** when detecting the need for careful action refinement.

## Key Features

- üîí **Automatic Detection**: Agent detects surgical intent from natural language
- üõ°Ô∏è **Isolation**: Changes tested in sandbox before integration
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Ensures no structural or interface changes
- üéØ **Generic**: Works with any BiOMapper action type
- üë§ **Transparent**: Users never see framework complexity

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Activation

When a user describes an issue that requires internal action changes:

```
User: "The statistics show 3675 proteins but should show unique entities"
Agent: [Automatically activates surgical mode]
       "I see the issue with incorrect counting logic. Let me fix that 
        while ensuring all output formats remain unchanged..."
```

### 2. Detection Patterns

The framework detects surgical need from patterns like:
- "Fix counting/statistics/logic in action"
- "Update without breaking pipeline"  
- "Should show unique entities"
- "3675 but should be 1200"
- "Counting expanded records instead of unique"

### 3. Safety Guarantees

Every surgical modification is validated for:
- **Context Interface**: Same keys read/written
- **Output Structure**: File formats unchanged
- **Data Types**: Type consistency maintained
- **Pipeline Integration**: No breaking changes

## Agent Integration

### Automatic Usage

```python
from core.safety import surgical_framework

# In agent's message processing
def process_user_message(message):
    # Automatically check for surgical need
    surgical_context = surgical_framework.process_user_message(message)
    
    if surgical_context:
        # Enter surgical mode transparently
        handle_surgical_modification(surgical_context)
    else:
        # Normal processing
        handle_standard_request(message)
```

### What Users See

Users interact naturally without knowing about surgical mode:

```
User: "The entity counting is wrong, it's counting all records"

Agent: I see the issue - the statistics are counting expanded records 
       instead of unique entities. Let me fix that while preserving 
       all your output formats...
       
       ‚úÖ Fixed! Statistics now correctly show unique entity counts.
       The output files maintain the same structure.
```

## Supported Action Types

The framework works generically with any action:

- `GENERATE_MAPPING_VISUALIZATIONS` - Statistics fixes
- `EXPORT_DATASET` - Format preservation issues
- `METABOLITE_CTS_BRIDGE` - API logic refinement
- `PROTEIN_NORMALIZE_ACCESSIONS` - Parsing updates
- Any future action needing surgical changes

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ActionSurgeon**: Main surgical executor
   - Captures baseline behavior
   - Validates changes are safe
   - Ensures no side effects

2. **SurgicalModeAgent**: Agent integration
   - Detects surgical intent
   - Manages activation/deactivation
   - Provides user responses

3. **SurgicalValidator**: Safety checks
   - Validates context interface
   - Checks output structures
   - Ensures type consistency

4. **ContextTracker**: Monitors access
   - Tracks context reads/writes
   - Detects interface changes
   - Records access patterns

## Example: Statistics Fix

### Problem
Visualization shows 3,675 proteins (expanded records) instead of ~1,200 unique entities.

### Surgical Solution

1. **Detection**: Framework detects "counting expanded records" pattern
2. **Isolation**: Creates sandbox with real pipeline data
3. **Baseline**: Captures current behavior
4. **Modification**: Updates counting logic internally
5. **Validation**: Verifies output structure unchanged
6. **Integration**: Applies validated changes

### Result
Statistics now show correct unique counts while maintaining exact same output file structure.

## Safety Validation Process

```
üì∏ Baseline Capture
  ‚Üì
üîß Apply Changes in Isolation
  ‚Üì
üîç Validation Checks:
  ‚Ä¢ Context interface preserved? ‚úÖ
  ‚Ä¢ Output structure unchanged? ‚úÖ
  ‚Ä¢ Data types consistent? ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Safe to Integrate
```

## Developer Usage

### Testing Surgical Changes

```python
from core.safety import SurgicalMode

# Use context manager for surgical operations
with SurgicalMode('GENERATE_MAPPING_VISUALIZATIONS') as surgeon:
    # Baseline automatically captured
    
    # Make your changes
    modified_action = apply_statistics_fix()
    
    # Validate automatically
    is_safe, messages = surgeon.validate_surgical_changes(modified_action)
    
    if is_safe:
        # Apply changes
        deploy_fix(modified_action)
```

### Adding New Detection Patterns

Edit patterns in `ActionSurgeon.SURGICAL_PATTERNS`:

```python
SURGICAL_PATTERNS = [
    r"your.*pattern.*here",
    # Existing patterns...
]
```

## Command Reference

While users never see these, agents can use:

- `/biomapper-surgical [ACTION] [ISSUE]` - Activate surgical mode
- Detection is automatic based on message patterns
- Validation happens transparently
- User only sees natural language responses

## Best Practices

1. **Let Detection Work**: Trust automatic pattern detection
2. **Preserve Everything**: Never change interfaces or structures
3. **Test in Isolation**: Always validate before integration
4. **User Transparency**: Hide framework complexity from users
5. **Document Changes**: Log what was modified internally

## Troubleshooting

### Detection Not Triggering
- Check if message matches patterns in `SURGICAL_PATTERNS`
- Verify action type is in registry
- Look for explicit action name mentions

### Validation Failures
- Context interface changed: Check read/write patterns
- Output structure changed: Verify file format preservation
- Type changes: Ensure data type consistency

### Integration Issues
- Test with real pipeline data
- Verify all output files generated
- Check context state after execution

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Machine learning for pattern detection
- [ ] Automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] Performance impact analysis
- [ ] Change history tracking
- [ ] Team collaboration features

## Summary

The Surgical Framework enables safe action refinement through:
- **Automatic activation** from natural language
- **Transparent operation** hidden from users
- **Comprehensive validation** of all changes
- **Generic support** for any action type
- **Safety guarantees** for pipeline stability

This allows fixing internal logic issues while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing pipelines and integrations.
