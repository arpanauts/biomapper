# Documentation Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Location:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/source/development/`  
**Verified by:** Automated documentation auditor

## Summary

Successfully verified and updated documentation files in the development directory against the actual BioMapper codebase. All documentation has been cross-referenced with source code, configuration files, and project resources to ensure technical accuracy.

## Files Verified and Updated

### 1. contributing.rst
**Status:** ✅ Updated and Verified

**Changes Made:**
- Corrected GitHub repository URL from generic to actual (arpanauts/biomapper)
- Removed reference to non-existent pre-commit hooks
- Updated Poetry installation verification command
- Corrected mypy command to include all packages (biomapper, biomapper-api, biomapper_client)
- Updated Python style guide with correct line length (120 chars as per ruff config)
- Added note about Python 3.11+ features being encouraged

**Verification Sources:**
- README.md (repository URL)
- pyproject.toml (dependencies and configuration)
- CLAUDE.md (development commands)
- Makefile (available commands)

### 2. creating_actions.rst
**Status:** ✅ Updated and Verified

**Changes Made:**
- Corrected import statement from `ActionResult` to `StandardActionResult`
- Updated all references to use correct result class from typed_base module
- Fixed import paths to match actual codebase structure
- Verified all code examples against actual action implementations

**Verification Sources:**
- biomapper/core/strategy_actions/typed_base.py (TypedStrategyAction base class)
- biomapper/core/strategy_actions/registry.py (action registration system)
- biomapper/core/strategy_actions/load_dataset_identifiers.py (example implementation)
- biomapper/core/models/action_results.py (result models)

### 3. testing.rst
**Status:** ✅ Updated and Verified

**Changes Made:**
- Corrected FastAPI app import from `biomapper_api.main` to `app.main`
- Verified test structure matches actual test directory layout
- Confirmed all pytest commands and coverage requirements

**Verification Sources:**
- tests/ directory structure
- pyproject.toml (test dependencies)
- CLAUDE.md (test commands)
- Makefile (test-related commands)

## Key Findings

### Accurate Information Confirmed
1. **Self-registering action system** - Verified via registry.py and decorator patterns
2. **TypedStrategyAction pattern** - Confirmed as primary base class for new actions
3. **Pydantic models** - Used throughout for parameter validation
4. **TDD approach** - Emphasized in both CLAUDE.md and documentation
5. **Poetry dependency management** - Confirmed as primary package manager

### Documentation Improvements
1. All code examples now use correct imports and class names
2. Repository URLs updated to actual GitHub location
3. Commands verified against Makefile and CLAUDE.md
4. Added verification sources to each documentation file for traceability

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates:** Documentation should be reviewed whenever major code changes occur
2. **Example Testing:** Consider adding automated tests for documentation code examples
3. **Cross-Reference:** Maintain links between related documentation files
4. **Version Tracking:** Consider adding version numbers to documentation

## Verification Method

Documentation was verified by:
1. Reading actual source code files
2. Checking import statements and class definitions
3. Validating commands against Makefile and scripts
4. Cross-referencing with README.md and CLAUDE.md
5. Examining pyproject.toml for dependencies and configuration

## Conclusion

All documentation in the development directory has been successfully verified and updated to match the current state of the BioMapper codebase. The documentation now accurately reflects:
- Correct import paths and class names
- Actual repository locations
- Valid commands and procedures
- Current project structure and patterns

The updates ensure developers have accurate, actionable information for contributing to the BioMapper project.
