# Documentation Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Purpose**: Remove documentation for non-existent action modules

## Summary

Updated BioMapper documentation to accurately reflect the actual codebase after major cleanup. The original documentation referenced 25+ actions, but only 13 actions actually exist in the current codebase.

## Actions Verified as Existing (13 total)

Based on `@register_action` grep analysis of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/actions/`:

### Data Operations (7)
- ✅ `LOAD_DATASET_IDENTIFIERS` - Load biological identifiers from CSV/TSV files
- ✅ `MERGE_DATASETS` - Combine multiple datasets with deduplication  
- ✅ `EXPORT_DATASET` - Export results to various formats
- ✅ `FILTER_DATASET` - Apply filtering criteria to datasets
- ✅ `CUSTOM_TRANSFORM` - Apply Python expressions to transform data columns
- ✅ `CUSTOM_TRANSFORM_EXPRESSION` - Enhanced expression-based data transformation
- ✅ `PARSE_COMPOSITE_IDENTIFIERS` - Parse and extract identifiers from composite fields

### Protein Actions (2)
- ✅ `PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS` - Extract UniProt IDs from compound reference fields
- ✅ `PROTEIN_NORMALIZE_ACCESSIONS` - Standardize protein accession formats

### Metabolite Actions (2)
- ✅ `NIGHTINGALE_NMR_MATCH` - Nightingale NMR platform matching
- ✅ `SEMANTIC_METABOLITE_MATCH` - AI-powered semantic matching

### Chemistry Actions (1)
- ✅ `CHEMISTRY_FUZZY_TEST_MATCH` - Match clinical test names using fuzzy string matching

### Integration Actions (1)
- ✅ `SYNC_TO_GOOGLE_DRIVE_V2` - Upload and sync results to Google Drive with chunked transfer

## Documentation Files Removed (12 total)

The following `.rst` files were deleted because their corresponding actions do not exist:

### Protein Actions (2 removed)
- ❌ `protein_multi_bridge.rst` - PROTEIN_MULTI_BRIDGE action does not exist
- ❌ `merge_with_uniprot_resolution.rst` - MERGE_WITH_UNIPROT_RESOLUTION action does not exist

### Metabolite Actions (4 removed)
- ❌ `metabolite_cts_bridge.rst` - METABOLITE_CTS_BRIDGE action does not exist
- ❌ `metabolite_extract_identifiers.rst` - METABOLITE_EXTRACT_IDENTIFIERS action does not exist
- ❌ `metabolite_normalize_hmdb.rst` - METABOLITE_NORMALIZE_HMDB action does not exist
- ❌ `vector_enhanced_match.rst` - VECTOR_ENHANCED_MATCH action does not exist

### Chemistry Actions (2 removed)
- ❌ `chemistry_extract_loinc.rst` - CHEMISTRY_EXTRACT_LOINC action does not exist
- ❌ `chemistry_vendor_harmonization.rst` - CHEMISTRY_VENDOR_HARMONIZATION action does not exist

### Analysis Actions (4 removed)
- ❌ `calculate_set_overlap.rst` - CALCULATE_SET_OVERLAP action does not exist
- ❌ `calculate_three_way_overlap.rst` - CALCULATE_THREE_WAY_OVERLAP action does not exist
- ❌ `calculate_mapping_quality.rst` - CALCULATE_MAPPING_QUALITY action does not exist
- ❌ `generate_metabolomics_report.rst` - GENERATE_METABOLOMICS_REPORT action does not exist

## Documentation Files Updated

### `/docs/source/actions/index.rst`
- Updated action count from "25+" to "13"
- Removed all toctree references to deleted actions
- Updated quick reference tables to only include existing actions
- Replaced example workflow to use only existing actions
- Updated verification sources with current date and accurate action count

### `/docs/source/index.rst`
- Updated architecture description from "30+" to "13" actions
- Updated available actions summary to reflect actual capabilities
- Updated verification sources with current date

## Verification Method

Actions were verified by searching for `@register_action` decorators in the source code:

```bash
grep -r "@register_action" /home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/actions/
```

This revealed exactly 13 registered actions, which now matches the documentation.

## Files Remaining

The following documentation files remain and correspond to actual actions:

- `chemistry_fuzzy_test_match.rst`
- `custom_transform.rst`
- `export_dataset.rst`
- `filter_dataset.rst` 
- `load_dataset_identifiers.rst`
- `merge_datasets.rst`
- `nightingale_nmr_match.rst`
- `protein_extract_uniprot.rst`
- `protein_normalize_accessions.rst`
- `semantic_metabolite_match.rst`

## Impact

This cleanup ensures that:
1. Documentation accurately reflects the actual codebase
2. Users won't be confused by references to non-existent actions
3. Build processes won't fail due to missing action references
4. New contributors can trust the documentation as a reliable reference

All remaining documentation has been verified against actual source code as of 2025-08-18.
