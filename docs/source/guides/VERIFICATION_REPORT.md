# Documentation Verification Report - Guides Directory

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Directory**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/source/guides/`

## Summary

Verified and updated 4 documentation files in the guides directory to ensure accuracy against the current codebase implementation.

## Files Updated

### 1. getting_started.md
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed API server startup command from `main:app` to `app.main:app`
- Updated action list from 3 to 35 actions with categorized listing
- Corrected API endpoint from legacy to v2 format
- Added synchronous client example as recommended approach
- Updated test and health check commands
- Added verification sources section

**Key Corrections**:
- API module path was incorrect
- Action count was outdated (listed 3, actually 35)
- Missing synchronous client usage pattern
- Outdated curl command format

### 2. installation.rst
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed API server command to use correct module path
- Added Docker installation section (experimental)
- Added CLI installation section with biomapper commands
- Enhanced troubleshooting with ChromaDB and import error solutions
- Added verification sources section

**Key Corrections**:
- API startup command had wrong module path
- Missing CLI installation instructions
- Incomplete troubleshooting section

### 3. quickstart.rst
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Updated test commands to include coverage option
- Added biomapper CLI usage example
- Added common actions section listing key actions
- Enhanced next steps with action reference link
- Added verification sources section

**Key Corrections**:
- Missing CLI command usage
- No mention of coverage testing
- Missing list of commonly used actions

### 4. first_mapping.rst
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Updated client code to show synchronous execution as primary method
- Replaced "three foundational actions" with accurate action listing
- Enhanced overlap example with MERGE_DATASETS step
- Added proper parameters for CALCULATE_SET_OVERLAP
- Added verification sources section

**Key Corrections**:
- Async-only client example (synchronous is simpler for beginners)
- Outdated action count and descriptions
- Missing intermediate merge step in overlap example
- Incomplete action parameters

## Technical Accuracy Improvements

1. **API Module Paths**: All references to `main:app` corrected to `app.main:app`
2. **Action Registry**: Updated from 3 actions to 35+ self-registering actions
3. **Client Usage**: Added synchronous `client.run()` as primary pattern
4. **CLI Commands**: Added biomapper CLI usage alongside script examples
5. **Testing**: Added coverage testing commands
6. **Docker Support**: Added experimental Docker instructions

## Cross-Reference Validation

All documentation was verified against:
- `biomapper-api/app/main.py` - API configuration
- `biomapper_client/client_v2.py` - Client implementation
- `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/registry.py` - Action registry
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project conventions
- `Makefile` - Build commands

## Recommendations

1. **Version Management**: Consider adding version numbers to documentation
2. **Examples Repository**: Link to a separate examples repository
3. **Video Tutorials**: Consider adding links to video walkthroughs
4. **Troubleshooting FAQ**: Expand troubleshooting with common issues
5. **Migration Guide**: Add guide for users upgrading from older versions
