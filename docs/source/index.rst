BioMapper Documentation
=======================

BioMapper is a YAML-based workflow platform built on a self-registering action system. While originally designed for biological data harmonization (proteins, metabolites, chemistry), its extensible architecture supports any workflow that can be expressed as a sequence of actions operating on shared execution context.

üéØ **Key Features**
-------------------

* **Self-registering action system** - Actions automatically register via decorators
* **Type-safe parameters** - Pydantic models provide validation and IDE support  
* **YAML workflow definition** - Declarative strategies without coding
* **Real-time progress tracking** - SSE events for long-running jobs
* **Extensible architecture** - Easy to add new actions and entity types
* **AI-ready design** - Built for integration with Claude Code and LLM assistance

üöÄ **Quick Start**
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install with Poetry
   poetry install --with dev,docs,api
   poetry shell
   
   # Start the API server
   cd biomapper-api && poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # Or use the CLI (from root directory)
   poetry run biomapper --help
   poetry run biomapper health

.. code-block:: python

   # Python client usage
   from biomapper_client import BiomapperClient
   
   client = BiomapperClient("http://localhost:8000")
   result = client.run("test_metabolite_simple", parameters={
       "input_file": "/data/metabolites.csv",
       "output_dir": "/tmp/results"
   })
   print(f"Status: {result['status']}")

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**
--------------------

BioMapper follows a modern microservices architecture with three layers:

1. **Client Layer** - Python client library (``biomapper_client``) for programmatic access
2. **API Layer** - FastAPI service with SQLite job persistence and SSE progress tracking
3. **Core Layer** - 30+ self-registering actions with strategy execution engine

The system uses a **registry pattern** where actions self-register via ``@register_action`` decorators, a **strategy pattern** for YAML-based workflow configuration, and a **pipeline pattern** for data flow through shared execution context. Actions are organized by biological entity (proteins, metabolites, chemistry) and automatically discovered at runtime.

üìö **Available Actions**
------------------------

BioMapper includes 30+ actions across categories:

* **Data Operations**: Load, merge, filter, export, transform
* **Protein Mapping**: UniProt resolution, accession normalization, multi-bridge
* **Metabolite Matching**: CTS, semantic, vector, NMR matching
* **Chemistry**: LOINC extraction, fuzzy matching, vendor harmonization
* **Analysis**: Set overlap, quality metrics, comprehensive reports
