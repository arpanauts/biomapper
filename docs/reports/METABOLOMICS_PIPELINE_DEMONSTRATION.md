# Mock shareable link (would be real after credential setup):
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xYz_metabolomics_v3.0_20250819
```

**To Enable**:
1. Place credentials at `~/.biomapper/gdrive_credentials.json`
2. Run with `--enable-drive-sync` flag
3. Shareable link will be automatically generated
