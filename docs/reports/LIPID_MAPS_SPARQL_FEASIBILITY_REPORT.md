# LIPID MAPS SPARQL Feasibility Report

## Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Decision**: **MIXED - Proceed with Caution**

While the coverage analysis shows promise (46.7% of unmapped metabolites are lipids with 23.3% potential improvement), the SPARQL performance testing reveals significant concerns that require careful mitigation.

## Phase 0 Validation Results

### 0.1 SPARQL Query Performance Testing

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Basic connectivity works**: Endpoint is accessible
- ✅ **Exact matching works well**: 80% success rate for known compounds (0.79s average)
- ✅ **Batch queries are faster**: 2x faster than individual queries
- ❌ **Average query time exceeds threshold**: 2.34s average (threshold: 2s)
- ❌ **Timeout issues**: Multiple 10+ second timeouts observed
- ⚠️ **Realistic names match poorly**: 0% exact matches, 50% fuzzy matches

**Performance Metrics:**
```
Average query time: 2.34s
Maximum query time: 10.29s (timeouts)
Batch vs Individual: Batch 2x faster (0.82s vs 1.67s)
Known compounds: 4/5 matched (80%)
Realistic names: 5/10 matched (50%)
```

### 0.2 Coverage Feasibility Analysis

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **High lipid percentage**: 46.7% of unmapped are lipids
- ✅ **Good improvement potential**: 23.3% coverage improvement
- ✅ **Acceptable total time**: 42 seconds for all queries
- ✅ **Excellent cost-benefit**: 33.33% improvement per minute

**Coverage Breakdown:**
```
Total unmapped: 30 (sample data)
Likely lipids: 14 (46.7%)
Estimated matches: 7 (50% match rate)
Coverage improvement: 23.3%
```

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Query Performance Instability
- Queries randomly timeout (10+ seconds)
- Average time exceeds acceptable threshold
- Performance unpredictable

### 2. Name Matching Challenges
- Common clinical names don't match exactly
- Must rely on fuzzy matching (lower confidence)
- Complex lipid notations poorly supported

### 3. SPARQL Complexity
- Requires proper PREFIX declarations
- String escaping critical for security
- No built-in fuzzy matching capabilities

## Go/No-Go Decision Analysis

### Arguments FOR Implementation
1. **High lipid percentage** (46.7%) justifies effort
2. **Significant coverage gain** (23.3% improvement)
3. **Batch queries work** and are 2x faster
4. **Cost-benefit positive** (33% improvement/minute)

### Arguments AGAINST Implementation
1. **Performance unreliable** (timeouts, >2s average)
2. **Poor realistic name matching** (0% exact)
3. **Added complexity** to pipeline
4. **External dependency** risk

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Proceed with These Mitigations:

#### 1. Aggressive Timeout Management
```python
# Set conservative timeout
timeout = 3  # seconds (not 10)
# Fail fast, continue pipeline
```

#### 2. Feature Flag Control
```yaml
# Default to OFF until proven stable
ENABLE_LIPID_MAPS: false
fail_on_error: false  # Never break pipeline
```

#### 3. Selective Lipid Processing
```python
# Only query high-confidence lipids
if metabolite['SUPER_PATHWAY'] != 'Lipid':
    skip()
```

#### 4. Caching Strategy
```python
# Cache successful matches for 24 hours
# Reduces repeated SPARQL queries
cache_ttl = 86400  # seconds
```

#### 5. Performance Monitoring
```python
# Log every query performance
# Alert if average > 3 seconds
# Auto-disable if timeouts > 20%
```

## Alternative Approaches

If SPARQL proves too unstable:

### Option 1: Static LIPID MAPS Export
- Download full database as CSV/JSON
- No SPARQL queries needed
- Predictable performance
- Update monthly

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
- Use static data for common lipids
- SPARQL only for rare/complex queries
- Best of both worlds

### Option 3: Different Database
- Explore SwissLipids API
- Consider HMDB REST API
- PubChem has better performance

## Implementation Phases (Revised)

### Phase 1: Minimal Implementation (4-6 hours)
- TDD tests with timeout scenarios
- Conservative timeout (3s)
- Feature flag (default OFF)
- Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Stability Testing (2-3 hours)
- Run against 100+ real metabolites
- Monitor timeout rates
- Measure actual improvement
- Document failure modes

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (2 hours)
- Add monitoring/alerting
- Create rollback procedure
- Document troubleshooting guide
- Set conservative thresholds

## Final Recommendation

**Proceed with implementation BUT:**

1. **Start with feature flag OFF** - Enable only after stability proven
2. **Set aggressive timeouts** - 3 seconds maximum
3. **Never block pipeline** - Always graceful degradation
4. **Monitor closely** - Track timeout rates and performance
5. **Have rollback ready** - Can disable instantly if issues arise

## Success Criteria

Before enabling in production:
- [ ] <10% timeout rate over 100 queries
- [ ] Average query time <2 seconds
- [ ] At least 40% match rate for lipids
- [ ] Zero pipeline failures caused by SPARQL
- [ ] Rollback tested and documented

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Technical Risk**: Medium (timeout/performance issues)
- **Coverage Benefit**: High (23% improvement potential)
- **Maintenance Burden**: Medium (external dependency)
- **Rollback Difficulty**: Low (feature flag control)

## Decision

**PROCEED** with implementation following the mitigation strategies above. The coverage benefit (23.3% improvement) justifies the effort, but only with proper safeguards in place.

The feature should be:
1. Implemented with comprehensive error handling
2. Deployed with feature flag OFF
3. Tested extensively before enabling
4. Monitored closely in production
5. Ready for instant rollback if needed
