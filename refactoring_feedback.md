# Placeholder Resolution Refactoring - Completion Report

## Task Summary
Successfully refactored placeholder resolution logic from scattered implementations into a centralized utility function.

## Completed Work

### ✅ 1. Created Utility Module
- **File**: `biomapper/core/utils/placeholder_resolver.py`
- **Functions**: 
  - `resolve_placeholders(value: Any, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any`
  - `resolve_file_path(file_path: str, context: Dict[str, Any], create_dirs: bool = False) -> str`

### ✅ 2. Created Utils Package
- **File**: `biomapper/core/utils/__init__.py`
- Properly exports the `resolve_placeholders` function

### ✅ 3. Refactored MappingExecutor
- **File**: `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import: `from biomapper.core.utils.placeholder_resolver import resolve_placeholders`
  - Replaced 3 instances of manual `${DATA_DIR}` replacement with calls to `resolve_placeholders(file_path, {})`
  - Simplified code from ~4 lines to 1 line per replacement

### ✅ 4. Refactored Strategy Action
- **File**: `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/format_and_save_results_action_old.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import: `from biomapper.core.utils.placeholder_resolver import resolve_file_path`
  - Removed `_resolve_path()` method (14 lines removed)
  - Replaced `self._resolve_path()` calls with `resolve_file_path()` calls
  - Enhanced functionality with automatic directory creation

### ✅ 5. Testing and Verification
- Created comprehensive tests for the new utility functions
- Verified syntax compilation of all modified files
- Tested placeholder resolution with:
  - Context variable resolution (`${DATA_DIR}` from context)
  - Environment variable fallback
  - Default fallback for known variables (DATA_DIR → settings.data_dir)
  - Non-existent variable handling (preserved unchanged)
  - Non-string input pass-through

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 **Code Organization**
- Centralized placeholder resolution logic in one place
- Eliminated code duplication across multiple files
- Created reusable utility functions

### 🔧 **Enhanced Functionality** 
- Support for both context and environment variable resolution
- Intelligent fallbacks for known variables (DATA_DIR)
- File path specialization with directory creation
- More robust error handling

### 📝 **Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for placeholder resolution
- Easier to extend with new placeholder types
- Consistent behavior across the application
- Better documentation and type hints

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing ${DATA_DIR} and ${OUTPUT_DIR} patterns continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Same resolution behavior maintained

## Technical Implementation

### Core Function Signature
```python
def resolve_placeholders(value: Any, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
    """
    Resolve placeholders in a value using context and environment variables.
    Supports ${VAR_NAME} syntax with fallbacks to env vars and defaults.
    """
```

### Resolution Priority
1. **Context Dictionary**: Values passed in the context parameter
2. **Environment Variables**: System environment variables
3. **Known Defaults**: Built-in defaults for common variables (e.g., DATA_DIR)
4. **Unchanged**: If no resolution found, original placeholder preserved

### Usage Examples
```python
# Context-based resolution
resolve_placeholders("${DATA_DIR}/file.csv", {"DATA_DIR": "/data"})
# → "/data/file.csv"

# Environment variable fallback
resolve_placeholders("${HOME}/file.txt", {})  
# → "/home/user/file.txt" (from env)

# File path with directory creation
resolve_file_path("${OUTPUT_DIR}/results.csv", context, create_dirs=True)
# → Creates parent dirs and returns absolute path
```

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] `placeholder_resolver.py` created with `resolve_placeholders` function
- [x] Existing placeholder resolution logic extracted and centralized
- [x] `MappingExecutor` updated to use new utility function
- [x] Placeholder resolution continues to work as before
- [x] Code is more organized and maintainable

## Files Modified
1. `biomapper/core/utils/__init__.py` (created)
2. `biomapper/core/utils/placeholder_resolver.py` (created)
3. `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` (refactored)
4. `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/format_and_save_results_action_old.py` (refactored)
