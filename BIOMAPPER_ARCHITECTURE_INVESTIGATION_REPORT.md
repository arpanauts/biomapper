# BioMapper Architecture & Operations Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

BioMapper is a general-purpose bioinformatics workflow platform built on FastAPI with a self-registering action system and YAML-based strategy execution. The platform demonstrates strong foundations in modularity, type safety, and developer experience through AI-assisted development. However, critical gaps exist in scalability, observability, security, and enterprise features that limit production readiness.

### Key Capabilities Confirmed
- **Modular Action System**: Self-registering actions via decorator pattern with 40+ biological entity actions
- **YAML Strategy Execution**: Direct runtime loading without database intermediary
- **Job Persistence**: SQLite-based checkpointing and recovery system
- **Type Safety Migration**: Active transition from Dict[str,Any] to Pydantic models
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Comprehensive Claude Code integration with TDD workflow

### Critical Gaps
- **No Distributed Execution**: Single-threaded async execution limits scalability
- **Limited Observability**: Basic logging only, no metrics or distributed tracing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: No secrets management, unrestricted action execution
- **Missing Enterprise Features**: No multi-tenancy, audit logging, or compliance controls
- **Weak Workflow Capabilities**: Basic conditionals only, no loops or parallelism

### Immediate Risks
1. **Scale Limitation**: Cannot handle concurrent workloads or large datasets effectively
2. **Security Exposure**: Plain-text credentials in environment files, no sandboxing
3. **Operational Blindness**: No metrics, monitoring, or alerting capabilities
4. **Data Governance**: No PII/PHI handling, encryption, or retention policies

## Detailed Findings

## 1. Execution & Scale Model

### Current Implementation
```python
# Single-threaded async execution in EnhancedExecutionEngine
async def execute_strategy(self, job, strategy, context):
    for index, step in enumerate(steps):
        result = await action.execute(params, context)
```

**Architecture:**
- **Execution Model**: Single-threaded asyncio with sequential step processing
- **Job Queue**: In-memory dictionary (`self.jobs: Dict[str, Job]`)
- **Concurrency**: Limited to async I/O operations, no true parallelism
- **Resource Isolation**: None - all actions share process memory

**Limitations:**
- No distributed execution capability
- No job prioritization or scheduling
- No resource limits or quotas
- Memory-bound for large datasets
- No horizontal scaling support

**Evidence:**
- `biomapper-api/app/services/execution_engine.py:265-335` - Sequential step execution
- `biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py:35` - In-memory job storage
- No worker pool, queue system, or orchestrator found

## 2. Reproducibility & Provenance

### Current Implementation
```python
# Basic provenance tracking in context
context["provenance"].append({
    "source": action_type,
    "timestamp": datetime.now(),
    "action": action_type,
    "details": {}
})
```

**Capabilities:**
- YAML strategies version-controlled in `configs/strategies/`
- Basic provenance records in execution context
- SQLite checkpoint storage with context snapshots

**Gaps:**
- No action versioning or pinning
- No input/output hashing for verification
- Incomplete context serialization (DataFrames as string type names)
- No comprehensive execution manifest
- Parameters not cryptographically signed

**Evidence:**
- `biomapper/core/minimal_strategy_service.py:417-445` - Basic provenance
- `biomapper-api/app/services/execution_engine.py:129-139` - Limited serialization

## 3. Observability

### Current State
**Logging:**
```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info(f"Executing strategy '{strategy_name}'")
```

**Capabilities:**
- Python standard logging throughout
- Execution logs stored in SQLite (`execution_logs` table)
- Basic step timing captured

**Critical Gaps:**
- **No Metrics Collection**: No Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, or custom metrics
- **No Distributed Tracing**: Cannot track requests across services
- **No Dashboards**: No Grafana, Kibana, or custom UI
- **No Alerting**: No PagerDuty, Slack, or email notifications
- **No APM**: No application performance monitoring

**Evidence:**
- `tests/monitoring/test_metrics.py` - Only RAG metrics for LLM features
- No prometheus_client, opentelemetry, or datadog imports found
- Basic logging only in all service files

## 4. Data Governance & Compliance

### Current State
**Data Handling:**
```python
# Plain environment variables
UNIPROT_API_BASE=https://rest.uniprot.org
CTS_API_BASE=https://cts.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/rest
```

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- **No Encryption**: Data stored unencrypted in SQLite and filesystem
- **No Access Control**: No RBAC, all users have full access
- **No Audit Trail**: Basic logs but no compliance-grade audit
- **No Data Classification**: No PII/PHI identification or handling
- **No Retention Policies**: No automatic data expiration or cleanup

**Storage:**
- SQLite database (`biomapper.db`) - no encryption
- Filesystem storage in `/tmp/biomapper/` - world-readable
- No S3/GCS/Azure blob storage integration

**Evidence:**
- `.env.template` - Plain text configuration
- `biomapper-api/app/core/config.py:48` - SQLite URL without encryption
- No encryption libraries or key management found
