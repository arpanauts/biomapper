## Data Requirements

The strategies require the following data files to execute fully:

### Source Data Files (Successfully Mocked)
✅ `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/arivale/metabolomics_metadata.tsv`
- Created test data with 20 sample metabolites
- Symbolic link created to test data

✅ `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/israeli10k/israeli10k_lipidomics_metadata.csv`
- Created test data with 15 sample lipids
- Symbolic link created to test data

✅ `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/israeli10k/israeli10k_metabolomics_metadata.csv`
- Created test data with 20 sample metabolites
- Symbolic link created to test data

### Target Ontology Files (Not Available for Testing)
❌ `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/kg2.10.2c_ontologies/kg2c_metabolites.csv`
- Required for KG2c mapping strategies
- Contains ~28,000 metabolite entries
- Not available in test environment

❌ `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/spoke_ontologies/spoke_compounds.tsv`
- Required for SPOKE mapping strategies
- Contains compound ontology data
- Not available in test environment

## Technical Findings

### 1. Strategy Loading ✅
- All 8 strategies were successfully parsed and loaded by the MinimalStrategyService
- YAML structure is valid and properly formatted
- Strategy names are correctly extracted from the YAML files

### 2. API Integration ✅
- V2 API endpoint (`/api/strategies/v2/execute`) is functional
- Async job execution system works correctly
- Job status tracking (`/api/strategies/v2/jobs/{job_id}/status`) is operational

### 3. Parameter Handling ⚠️
- Strategies use `${metadata.source_files[0].path}` for file paths
- This variable substitution mechanism is not working as expected
- Parameters cannot override metadata paths at runtime
- Strategies are not flexible enough for testing with alternative data sources

### 4. Error Reporting ⚠️
- Error messages are not informative: "File not found: ${metadata.source_files[0].path}"
- The actual path being looked for is not shown in the error
- Makes debugging difficult

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **For Production Testing**
   - Obtain actual KG2c and SPOKE ontology files
   - Place them in the expected locations
   - Re-run tests with complete data

2. **For Development Testing**
   - Create simplified test strategies that don't require ontology files
   - Focus on testing individual action components
   - Use mock data that matches the expected schema

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Strategy Flexibility**
   - Modify strategies to accept file paths as parameters
   - Use default values that can be overridden at runtime
   - Example:
   ```yaml
   parameters:
     source_file: "${SOURCE_FILE:-/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/arivale/metabolomics_metadata.tsv}"
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages to show actual file paths
   - Add file existence validation before execution
   - Provide more context in failure messages

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create a dedicated test data directory with minimal ontology files
   - Develop unit tests for individual strategy actions
   - Implement integration tests with known input/output pairs

## Test Artifacts Created

1. **Test Scripts**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/test_metabolite_strategies_v3.py` - Main test runner with async support
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/generate_metabolite_test_data.py` - Test data generator

2. **Test Data**
   - `/tmp/metabolite_test_data/arivale_metabolites.tsv`
   - `/tmp/metabolite_test_data/israeli_lipids.tsv`
   - `/tmp/metabolite_test_data/israeli_metabolites.tsv`

3. **Documentation**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metabolite_test_summary.md` - Initial test summary
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metabolite_test_final_report.md` - This report

## Conclusion

All 8 metabolite strategies are structurally valid and can be loaded and initiated by the biomapper API. However, they cannot be fully executed in the test environment due to dependencies on large ontology files that are not available. 

The strategies demonstrate:
- ✅ Proper YAML structure and metadata
- ✅ Valid action definitions
- ✅ Comprehensive multi-bridge resolution approach
- ⚠️ Limited flexibility for testing environments
- ⚠️ Hard dependencies on specific file locations

To complete testing, either:
1. Obtain the actual ontology files from the production environment
2. Modify the strategies to be more flexible and testable
3. Create simplified versions specifically for testing

The test infrastructure and framework created during this testing session can be reused once the data dependencies are resolved.
