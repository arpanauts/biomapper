# Resource Metadata System Integration Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for fully integrating the Resource Metadata System with the SQLite Mapping Cache and other Biomapper resources. The integration will create a unified, intelligent mapping system that automatically routes queries to the most appropriate resources based on capabilities and performance metrics.

A key architectural decision is the adoption of a generalized knowledge graph approach, ensuring that Biomapper can function with or without specific proprietary knowledge graphs like SPOKE. This abstraction layer will enable users to configure their own knowledge graph sources while maintaining the benefits of the unified metadata system.

## Background

Biomapper has already implemented several key components:
1. The SQLite mapping cache with bidirectional transitivity
2. Initial knowledge graph integration capabilities (primarily for SPOKE)
3. Initial Resource Metadata System architecture

This plan evolves the implementation to provide a generalized, configurable approach that works with multiple knowledge graph sources. The abstraction layer preserves the hybrid architecture benefits while removing dependencies on specific licensed resources.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Abstraction and Metadata Setup (Week 1)

1. **Knowledge Graph Abstraction Layer**
   - Define base protocols and interfaces for knowledge graph interactions (`KnowledgeGraphClient`)
   - Create adapter implementations for SPOKE (as a reference implementation)
   - Develop a configuration system for specifying knowledge graph schemas
   - Implement validation for knowledge graph configurations

2. **Configuration Foundation**
   - Create configuration files for all resources (SQLite, Knowledge Graphs, External APIs)
   - Support environment variable configuration overrides
   - Implement configuration validation logic
   - Create schema mapping configuration format for knowledge graph adapters

3. **Metadata Database Initialization**
   - Create initialization script using the `initialize_metadata_system()` function
   - Add verification tools to ensure tables are properly created
   - Implement database migration utilities for future schema changes
   - Add knowledge graph type registration in the metadata schema

### Phase 2: Knowledge Graph Integration and Resource Registration (Week 1-2)

1. **Knowledge Graph Schema Analysis**

   - Create `biomapper metadata` command group with subcommands:
     - `init`: Initialize the metadata system
     - `register`: Register new resources
     - `list`: List registered resources
     - `stats`: Show performance statistics
     - `optimize`: Optimize resource priorities

2. **API Endpoint Integration**
