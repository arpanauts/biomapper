# RAG Performance Evaluation Plan for Ontological Mapping

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for evaluating the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for ontological mapping in Biomapper. It addresses the need for specialized evaluation metrics that capture both technical efficacy and biological relevance of the mapping results. The plan includes the development of evaluation frameworks, benchmark datasets, and integration with the existing resource metadata system.

## Background

Ontological mapping in biology presents unique challenges that standard NLP evaluation metrics may not fully address. Biological entities often have complex relationships, hierarchical structures, and domain-specific nuances that require specialized evaluation approaches. As RAG methodologies become increasingly central to Biomapper's mapping capabilities, developing robust evaluation frameworks becomes crucial for:

1. Ensuring biological accuracy and relevance
2. Optimizing retrieval and generation components
3. Comparing performance across different ontologies
4. Establishing benchmarks for future improvements

## Scope and Objectives

1. Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework for RAG-based ontological mapping
2. Implement multi-dimensional metrics that address both technical and biological aspects
3. Create gold-standard benchmark datasets for consistent evaluation

## Technical Design

### Evaluation Metrics Schema

```python
class RetrievalMetrics:
    """Metrics for evaluating retrieval quality."""
    precision_at_k: Dict[int, float]  # P@k for different k values
    recall_at_k: Dict[int, float]  # R@k for different k values
    ndcg: float  # Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
    mrr: float  # Mean Reciprocal Rank
    context_relevance: float  # Semantic similarity to query

class GenerationMetrics:
    """Metrics for evaluating generation quality."""
    context_fidelity: float  # Adherence to retrieved context
    hallucination_rate: float  # Rate of unsupported statements
    consistency: float  # Internal consistency of mapping
    latency_ms: int  # Response time in milliseconds

class OntologyMetrics:
    """Metrics specific to ontological mapping."""
    taxonomic_distance: float  # Distance in ontology hierarchy
    property_similarity: float  # Jaccard similarity of properties
    transitive_consistency: float  # Logical consistency across mappings
    expert_agreement: float  # Agreement with expert annotations
```

### Database Schema Extension

```sql
-- Extension to performance_metrics table for RAG-specific metrics
ALTER TABLE performance_metrics
ADD COLUMN extended_metrics TEXT;  -- JSON storage for detailed metrics

-- New table for benchmark results
CREATE TABLE benchmark_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    benchmark_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    resource_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    execution_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    overall_score REAL,
    detailed_results TEXT,  -- JSON storage for detailed results
    FOREIGN KEY (resource_id) REFERENCES resource_metadata(id)
);
```

### Integration with Resource Metadata System

```python
# Example of logging RAG performance metrics
def log_rag_mapping_operation(self, resource_name, query, result, metrics):
    """Log RAG mapping operation with detailed metrics.
    
    Args:
        resource_name: Name of RAG resource
        query: Original mapping query
        result: Mapping result
        metrics: Detailed performance metrics
    """
    self.metadata_manager.log_operation(
        resource_name=resource_name,
        operation_type=OperationType.MAP,
        source_type=query.source_type,
        target_type=query.target_type,
        query=query.text,
        response_time_ms=metrics.get("latency_ms", 0),
        status=OperationStatus.SUCCESS if result else OperationStatus.ERROR,
        extended_metrics=json.dumps(metrics)
    )
```

   - Compound names ↔ Standard identifiers

2. **Challenging Cases**:
   - Ambiguous entity names
   - Entities with multiple valid mappings
   - Entities requiring contextual disambiguation
   - Rare and specialized biological entities

3. **Cross-Ontology Chains**:
