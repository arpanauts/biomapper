# Completed Features Log

[This log is updated automatically by the STAGE_GATE_PROMPT_COMPL.md when features are moved to 3_completed.]

- **MetaMapper Database CLI:** Completed 2025-05-23. Implemented comprehensive CLI for querying and validating metamapper.db configuration database with support for resource inspection, path discovery, and client validation.
- **Fix is_one_to_many_target Flag Bug:** Completed 2025-05-23. Fixed critical bug where one-to-many relationship flags were swapped in phase3 reconciliation, correcting flag assignments in 7 locations to properly identify source and target relationships.
- **PubChemRAGMappingClient:** Completed 2025-05-23. Implemented semantic search-based metabolite mapping client using Qdrant vector database with 2.2M PubChem embeddings, achieving 70-90 queries/second performance for improved metabolite name resolution.
- **MVP 0 - Arivale BIOCHEMICAL_NAME RAG Mapping Pipeline Components:** Completed 2025-05-24. Implemented and tested the three core components (Qdrant Search, PubChem Annotator, LLM Mapper) for the Arivale biochemical name RAG mapping pipeline.
- **MVP 0 - Pipeline Orchestrator:** Completed 2025-05-24. Implemented a three-stage (Qdrant search, PubChem annotation, LLM mapping) pipeline orchestrator for biochemical name mapping with configuration management, error handling, and comprehensive testing.

- **Core Metamapper Configuration for Protein Datasets:** Completed 2025-05-28. Successfully configured metamapper.db for UKBB, HPA, and Qin protein datasets via populate_metamapper_db.py.
- **MappingExecutor Performance Optimization:** Completed 2025-05-30. Implemented client caching in MappingExecutor, achieving a ~16x speedup by mitigating repeated CSV loading.
- **Update populate_metamapper_db.py for UKBB/Arivale File Resources:** Completed 2025-05-30. Enhanced script to use UKBB/Arivale metadata files for new lookup resources via ArivaleMetadataLookupClient.
- **Fix phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py one-to-many bug:** Completed 2025-05-30. Corrected flag logic by filtering for valid mappings, ensuring accurate one-to-many relationship identification.
