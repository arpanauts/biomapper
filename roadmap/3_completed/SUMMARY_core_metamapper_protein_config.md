# Feature Summary: Core Metamapper Configuration for Protein Datasets

## Purpose
The primary goal was to establish a robust and comprehensive configuration within `metamapper.db` to accurately describe protein datasets (UKBB, HPA, Qin), their primary identifiers (UniProtKB ACs), and the mechanisms for looking them up. This foundational setup is crucial for enabling reliable data integration and mapping operations by the `MappingExecutor` within the Biomapper project.

## What Was Built
-   The `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` script was significantly updated and debugged.
-   This script now correctly defines and populates `metamapper.db` with:
    -   `Ontology` and `Property` entries for `UNIPROTKB_AC`.
    -   `Endpoint` entries for the UKBB, HPA, and Qin protein datasets.
    -   `PropertyExtractionConfig` to specify UniProt AC extraction from their respective source files (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv`, `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/isb_osp/hpa_osps.csv`, `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/isb_osp/qin_osps.csv`).
    -   `EndpointPropertyConfig` linking these extractions to endpoints and designating them as primary identifiers.
    -   `MappingResource` entries for each dataset, configured to use `GenericFileLookupClient` for identity lookups. This included ensuring `config_template` uses `json.dumps()` for correct JSON formatting and specifies correct file paths, delimiters, and column names.
    -   `OntologyCoverage` entries confirming these resources map `UNIPROTKB_AC` to `UNIPROTKB_AC`.
-   The `populate_metamapper_db.py` script now runs successfully, creating a valid `metamapper.db`.

## Notable Design Decisions or Functional Results
-   **`json.dumps()` for `config_template`:** Ensured that the `config_template` for `MappingResource` entries is stored as a valid JSON string, which is critical for the `GenericFileLookupClient` and other potential clients.
-   **`PropertyExtractionConfig` Usage:** Correctly utilized `property_extraction_config_id` in `EndpointPropertyConfig` to link to detailed extraction configurations.
-   **Permissions Resolution:** Identified and resolved file ownership issues (`chown`) that were preventing Claude Code instances from writing feedback files, which unblocked parts of the development process.
-   **Successful Database Population:** The `metamapper.db` is now populated with the necessary metadata for these three key protein resources, paving the way for their use in mapping pipelines.
