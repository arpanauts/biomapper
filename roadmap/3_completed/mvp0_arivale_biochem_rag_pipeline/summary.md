# Feature Summary: MVP 0 - Arivale BIOCHEMICAL_NAME RAG Mapping Pipeline Components

## Purpose

The primary goal of this feature was to implement the core components of the MVP0 Arivale BIOCHEMICAL_NAME RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Mapping Pipeline. This pipeline aims to map biochemical names from Arivale's metabolomics dataset to standardized PubChem Compound IDs (CIDs) by leveraging vector search, detailed chemical annotations, and Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making.

## What Was Built

Three distinct, asynchronous Python components were developed and individually tested:

1.  **`qdrant_search.py`**:
    *   Accepts a biochemical name and `top_k` value.
    *   Utilizes the existing `PubChemRAGMappingClient` to query a Qdrant vector database (containing PubChem embeddings) for semantically similar biochemical entities.
    *   Returns a list of candidate CIDs along with their Qdrant similarity scores.
    *   Includes configuration management via environment variables and Pydantic models.

2.  **`pubchem_annotator.py`**:
    *   Accepts a list of PubChem CIDs.
    *   Fetches detailed chemical annotations for each CID from the PubChem PUG REST API using asynchronous `httpx` calls. Fetched attributes include title, IUPAC name, molecular formula, SMILES, InChIKey, synonyms, and description.
    *   Implements rate limiting using `asyncio.Semaphore` to adhere to PubChem API guidelines.
    *   Returns a dictionary mapping each successfully annotated CID to a `PubChemAnnotation` Pydantic model.

3.  **`llm_mapper.py`**:
    *   Accepts the original biochemical name and a list of `LLMCandidateInfo` objects (each containing a CID, its Qdrant score, and its PubChem annotations).
    *   Constructs a detailed prompt for an Anthropic LLM (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet).
    *   Sends the prompt to the LLM to select the most appropriate CID that matches the original biochemical name, or to indicate no good match.
    *   Parses the LLM's structured JSON response to extract the selected CID, a confidence level, and the rationale.
    *   Returns an `LLMChoice` Pydantic model.
    *   Manages the Anthropic API key securely via environment variables.

Pydantic schemas for data interchange between these components (e.g., `QdrantSearchResultItem`, `PubChemAnnotation`, `LLMCandidateInfo`) are defined in `biomapper/schemas/mvp0_schema.py`. Each component includes example usage for standalone testing and comprehensive unit tests.

## Notable Design Decisions or Functional Results

*   **Modularity & Asynchronicity**: Components are designed to be modular and leverage `asyncio` for efficient I/O-bound operations, particularly for API calls.
*   **Configuration Management**: Each component relies on environment variables with sensible defaults for key configurations (API keys, Qdrant settings, LLM model names), managed via Pydantic models where appropriate. This will be centralized in the upcoming pipeline orchestrator.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Each component incorporates error handling for API issues, missing data, and unexpected responses, with detailed logging.
*   **Structured Data Flow**: Pydantic models ensure type-safe and structured data transfer between components.
*   **LLM for Disambiguation**: The use of an LLM for the final mapping decision allows for nuanced interpretation of semantic similarity scores and rich chemical annotations, aiming to improve accuracy over purely algorithmic methods.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Each component was delivered with unit tests and example usage scripts, which were confirmed via feedback files.
*   **Iterative Feedback**: The development process involved iterative feedback and refinement for each component, ensuring they met specified acceptance criteria.
