# Architecture Review Notes - MetaMapper Database CLI

## Suggested Architecture Reviews

The following sections of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_reference/architecture_notes.md` may benefit from updates based on the MetaMapper Database CLI implementation:

1. **CLI Architecture Section** (new section needed):
   - Document the modular CLI structure using Click command groups
   - Explain the async database session management pattern
   - Define conventions for CLI command organization

2. **Database Access Patterns Section** (new section needed):
   - Document the async SQLAlchemy patterns used
   - Explain the session lifecycle management approach
   - Define best practices for database queries in CLI contexts

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Document the use of environment variables for database URLs
   - Explain the settings hierarchy for metamapper_db_url

## Integration Points

The MetaMapper Database CLI integrates with:
- `biomapper.db.session` for database management
- `biomapper.db.models` for ORM models
- `biomapper.config` for settings management
- `biomapper.cli.main` for CLI registration

These integration points should be documented in the architecture notes for future reference.
