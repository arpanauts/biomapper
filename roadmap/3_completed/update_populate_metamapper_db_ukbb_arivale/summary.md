# Summary: Update populate_metamapper_db.py for UKBB/Arivale File Resources

The `populate_metamapper_db.py` script was successfully updated to integrate new file-based lookup resources for UKBB protein metadata and to enhance existing Arivale protein metadata lookups.

Key achievements include:
-   Addition of a new `UKBB_ASSAY_ID` ontology.
-   Creation of bidirectional mapping resources between `UKBB_ASSAY_ID` and `UNIPROTKB_AC` using the `UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv` file.
-   Correction and enhancement of configurations for Arivale lookup resources (`arivale_lookup`, `arivale_reverse_lookup`, `arivale_genename_lookup`), including adding delimiters and ensuring correct file paths and column names.
-   Addition of `OntologyCoverage` entries for all new and modified resources.

The changes utilize the existing `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` for file-based lookups, promoting code reuse. The script was tested and confirmed to run successfully, populating `metamapper.db` correctly. These updates enable the `MappingExecutor` to use these new file-based lookup capabilities.
