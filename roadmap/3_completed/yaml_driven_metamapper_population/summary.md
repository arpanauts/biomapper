# Feature Summary: YAML-Driven Metamapper Database Population

## Purpose
To refactor the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` script to dynamically populate the `metamapper.db` based on configurations defined in YAML files (e.g., `protein_config.yaml`). The goal was to make the database population process modular, extensible, and easier to manage as new entity types and data sources are added, moving away from hardcoded population logic.

## What Was Built
- The `populate_metamapper_db.py` script was significantly refactored.
- It now includes logic to discover and parse `*_config.yaml` files from the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/` directory.
- Modular asynchronous functions were implemented to populate different aspects of the database (`Ontology`, `Endpoint`, `MappingResource`, `MappingPath`, etc.) based on the parsed YAML data.
- A `ConfigurationValidator` was introduced to check YAML files for required fields, file path existence (with environment variable resolution for `${DATA_DIR}`), and internal consistency of references (e.g., ontology types, resource names) before attempting database population.
- The old hardcoded data population logic was removed, making the YAML files the sole source of truth for `metamapper.db` content related to entity and resource definitions.

## Notable Design Decisions or Functional Results
- **Modularity:** The script is now highly modular, with specific functions for populating different parts of the schema based on YAML sections.
- **Extensibility:** Adding new entity types or data sources primarily involves creating a new YAML configuration file rather than modifying Python code extensively.
- **Validation:** The `ConfigurationValidator` enhances robustness by catching common configuration errors early.
- **Environment Variable Resolution:** Support for `${DATA_DIR}` (resolved via `settings.data_dir`) in YAML paths makes configurations more portable.
- **Successful Population:** The script successfully populates `metamapper.db` from `protein_config.yaml`, enabling downstream processes like `MappingExecutor` to use this metadata.
- This refactoring directly supports the project's strategic shift towards a more declarative and YAML-centric configuration approach.
