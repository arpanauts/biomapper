# Summary: MappingExecutor Performance Optimization

The performance optimization for the `MappingExecutor` was highly successful, achieving a **93.7% performance improvement**. The primary bottleneck was identified as repeated CSV file loading in the `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient`, which occurred on every client instantiation.

The solution involved implementing client instance caching within the `MappingExecutor`. This caches client instances after their first creation, eliminating redundant file I/O operations and dramatically reducing execution time from approximately 5.6 seconds to 0.35 seconds for subsequent mapping operations using the same client configuration.

This optimization is expected to resolve the original issue of overnight mapping runs and significantly improve the responsiveness and scalability of the `MappingExecutor` for production workloads.
