# Implementation Notes: Fix is_one_to_many_target Flag Bug

## Date: 2025-05-23

### Progress:

- Identified root cause: flags are swapped in the implementation
- Created comprehensive planning documentation
- Moved to implementation stage
- Identified exact lines that need to be changed
- Implemented all fixes (7 locations total, not just the initial 4):
  - Line 581: Fixed to set one_to_many_source when source has multiple targets
  - Line 609: Fixed to set one_to_many_target when target has multiple sources
  - Line 942: Fixed to set one_to_many_target for reverse-only mappings
  - Line 1016: Fixed to set one_to_many_source based on forward targets
  - Line 1025: Fixed to set one_to_many_target based on reverse sources
  - Line 1049: Fixed to set one_to_many_target when target has multiple sources
  - Line 1058: Fixed to set one_to_many_source when source has multiple targets
- Created and ran comprehensive test suite - all tests pass
- Verified fix resolves the issue in synthetic test data

### Decisions Made:

- Implemented the simplest fix: swap the flag assignments
- Added clarifying comments at each change point explaining the correct logic
- Created comprehensive test script that validates all relationship types
- Found additional locations that needed fixing beyond the initial 4 (7 total fixes)

### Challenges Encountered:

- Initially identified 4 locations to fix, but testing revealed 3 more locations (7 total)
- The logic was swapped in multiple places throughout the function, not just in the post-processing section

### Next Steps:

- ✓ Implement the code changes - COMPLETE
- ✓ Create and run test script - COMPLETE
- ✓ Validate with synthetic test data - COMPLETE
- Move to completion stage and create summary
