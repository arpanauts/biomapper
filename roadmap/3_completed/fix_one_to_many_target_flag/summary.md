# Feature Summary: Fix is_one_to_many_target Flag Bug

## Purpose

The purpose of this fix was to resolve a critical bug in the phase3 bidirectional reconciliation script where the `is_one_to_many_target` flag was incorrectly set to TRUE for approximately 64% of all records. This bug compromised the reliability of relationship identification in protein mappings, making it impossible to distinguish actual one-to-many target relationships from other relationship types.

## What Was Built

The fix involved correcting swapped flag assignments in 7 locations within the `perform_bidirectional_validation` function in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`. The core issue was that `is_one_to_many_source` and `is_one_to_many_target` flags were being set inversely - sources with multiple targets were incorrectly flagged as one-to-many targets, and targets with multiple sources were incorrectly flagged as one-to-many sources. Each fix was accompanied by clarifying comments explaining the correct logic to prevent future confusion.

## Notable Design Decisions or Functional Results

The implementation revealed that the bug was more pervasive than initially thought, requiring fixes in 7 locations rather than the 4 originally identified. A comprehensive test suite was created that validates all relationship types (one-to-one, one-to-many source, one-to-many target, and many-to-many), and all tests now pass successfully. The fix is minimal and surgical, swapping only the flag assignments without changing any other logic, ensuring no regression in other functionality. The corrected implementation now properly identifies that a source mapping to multiple targets should set `is_one_to_many_source=True`, and a target mapped by multiple sources should set `is_one_to_many_target=True`.
