# Implementation Notes: MVP 0 - Pipeline Orchestrator

## Date: 2025-05-24

### Progress:

- Initial setup of the feature folder.
- Task list generated.
- Implementation notes file created.

### Decisions Made:

- The orchestrator will be a new, distinct feature (`mvp0_pipeline_orchestrator`) in the roadmap, rather than a direct continuation of the `mvp0_arivale_biochem_rag_pipeline` feature folder.

### Challenges Encountered:

- Initial confusion about the location/existence of the `1_todo` roadmap stage, clarified to use `0_backlog` or `1_planning`.

### Next Steps:

- Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks from `task_list.md`, starting with `Task 1.1: Create the main orchestrator file: biomapper/mvp0_pipeline/pipeline_orchestrator.py`.
- Define `PipelineConfig` and `PipelineMappingResult` Pydantic models.
