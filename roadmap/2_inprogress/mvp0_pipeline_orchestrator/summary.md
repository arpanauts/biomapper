# Summary: MVP 0 - Pipeline Orchestrator

**Feature Completion Date:** 2025-05-24

## 1. Purpose

The "MVP 0 - Pipeline Orchestrator" provides a robust framework to manage and execute the Arivale BIOCHEMICAL_NAME RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) mapping pipeline. Its core purpose is to automate the multi-stage process of mapping input biochemical names to PubChem Compound IDs (CIDs) by:
1.  Searching a Qdrant vector database for candidate CIDs.
2.  Fetching detailed annotations for these candidates from PubChem.
3.  Utilizing an LLM (e.g., Claude) to analyze the candidates and select the most appropriate CID.

The orchestrator handles configuration, sequential execution of pipeline stages, error management, status reporting, and logging.

## 2. How It Was Built & Key Components

The orchestrator was developed in three main phases:
*   **Phase 1: Core Setup & Configuration:** Established foundational Pydantic models for configuration (`PipelineConfig`) and results (`PipelineStatus`, `PipelineMappingResult`, `BatchMappingResult`), and set up the basic orchestrator class structure.
*   **Phase 2: Core Logic & Integration:** Implemented the main orchestration logic, including the three-stage pipeline execution, error handling, status updates, configuration validation (API keys, Qdrant connectivity), and sequential batch processing.
*   **Phase 3: Testing & Polish:** Added comprehensive unit and integration tests, full docstrings, a detailed README, and performed code refactoring for robustness and clarity.

**Key Components & Files:**
*   **Orchestrator Logic:** `PipelineOrchestrator` class in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mvp0_pipeline/pipeline_orchestrator.py`. This class contains the `run_single_mapping()` method for individual inputs and `run_pipeline()` for batch processing.
*   **Configuration:** `PipelineConfig` Pydantic model in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mvp0_pipeline/pipeline_config.py`. It loads settings from environment variables (e.g., API keys, Qdrant URL) with sensible defaults and includes a factory function `create_pipeline_config()` for instantiation and validation.
*   **Data Schemas:**
    *   `PipelineStatus` (Enum), `PipelineMappingResult`, and `BatchMappingResult` Pydantic models are defined in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/schemas/pipeline_schema.py`. These provide structured input/output and detailed status reporting.
*   **Factory Function:** `create_orchestrator()` in `pipeline_orchestrator.py` for easy and validated instantiation.
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite using `pytest` and `unittest.mock` is located in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/mvp0_pipeline/test_pipeline_orchestrator.py`.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   In-code: Google Python style docstrings for all classes and methods.
    *   User Guide: A detailed `README.md` in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mvp0_pipeline/README.md` covering architecture, setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

## 3. Notable Decisions & Results

*   **Sequential Processing:** For MVP0, batch processing of biochemical names is handled sequentially. Concurrent processing is identified as a future enhancement.
*   **Fail-Fast Error Handling:** The pipeline stops processing for a specific input upon the first error encountered in any stage. Granular `PipelineStatus` codes and error messages are reported. Retry logic is a future enhancement.
*   **Configuration Validation:** Essential configurations (API keys, Qdrant settings) and Qdrant service connectivity are validated during orchestrator initialization.
*   **Modularity & Component Re-use:** The orchestrator integrates the existing, independently developed components (`qdrant_search`, `pubchem_annotator`, `llm_mapper`) using their defined async interfaces. Components manage their own client initializations.
*   **Schema Organization:** Pipeline-specific Pydantic models were placed in a new `biomapper/schemas/pipeline_schema.py` for better separation from general `mvp0_schema.py`.
*   **Logging Strategy:** High-level logging of key events, inputs, outputs, and errors is implemented. Detailed logging of intermediate results is a future enhancement.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The feature includes a robust suite of unit and integration tests, ensuring reliability.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Significant effort was invested in creating clear docstrings and a comprehensive README to facilitate understanding and usage.
