# Implementation Notes: Debug UKBB to HPA Protein Mapping Failures

**Date Started:** 2025-05-28

## Log

### 2025-05-28
-   Feature folder created and moved to `2_inprogress`.
-   Initial `task_list.md` generated based on `spec.md` and `design.md`.
-   Awaiting feedback from the Claude Code instance initiated via `claude` CLI to perform initial debugging steps. The prompt for this instance is in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-28-160629-debug-ukbb-hpa-mapping-failure.md`.
-   Key areas of investigation:
    -   Correctness of file paths in `populate_metamapper_db.py` for `UKBB_Protein_Meta_head.tsv` and `hpa_osps.csv`.
    -   Column names used for UniProt ID extraction ("UniProt" in UKBB, "uniprot" in HPA).
    -   Lookup logic within `GenericFileLookupClient`.
    -   Data integrity of the first 10 UniProt IDs in `UKBB_Protein_Meta_head.tsv`.
