# README: Debug UKBB to HPA Protein Mapping Failures

This feature focuses on identifying and resolving the root causes of failures in the UKBB to HPA protein mapping process.

**Parent Idea:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/0_backlog/debug_ukbb_hpa_mapping_failures.md`

**Goal:** Achieve successful and accurate protein ID mapping between UKBB and HPA datasets.

**Key Activities:**
- Analyze `map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` script execution.
- Verify configurations in `populate_metamapper_db.py`.
- Inspect data files and UniProt ID matching logic.
- Implement necessary fixes or logging to diagnose the issue.

Refer to `spec.md` for detailed specifications and `design.md` for the approach.
