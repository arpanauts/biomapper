# Feature Idea: MappingExecutor Performance Optimization

**Source:** Identified in status update `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-30-mapping-executor-performance-issue.md`

**Problem:** The `MappingExecutor` is exhibiting severe performance degradation, with mapping tasks running overnight without completion. This blocks further testing and development.

**Goal:** Diagnose the root cause of the performance bottleneck and implement optimizations to restore efficient execution of the `MappingExecutor`.
