# Backlog: PubChemRAGMappingClient - Batch Processing Optimization

## 1. Overview

The `PubChemRAGMappingClient`'s `map_identifiers` method processes a list of identifiers. The feedback for the Qdrant score enhancement feature suggested that the current implementation could be optimized for batch processing of large identifier lists.

This task is to investigate and implement performance optimizations for `map_identifiers` when dealing with a large number of input identifiers.

## 2. Goal

*   Improve the throughput and reduce the processing time of `PubChemRAGMappingClient.map_identifiers` for large batches.
*   Ensure the client remains robust and memory-efficient during large batch operations.

## 3. Scope

*   Analyze the current implementation of `map_identifiers` and its interactions with `QdrantVectorStore.search()` to identify potential bottlenecks for batch operations.
*   Investigate if `QdrantVectorStore.search()` itself can be made more batch-friendly or if Qdrant offers batch search endpoints that could be leveraged.
*   Implement optimizations, which might include:
    *   Processing identifiers in internal mini-batches.
    *   Optimizing data structure handling.
    *   Leveraging asynchronous capabilities more effectively for batch calls if applicable.
*   Benchmark the performance before and after changes.
*   Update tests.

## 4. Potential Considerations

*   The nature of the underlying `QdrantVectorStore` and `qdrant_client` capabilities for batching.
*   Trade-offs between throughput, latency, and memory usage.
