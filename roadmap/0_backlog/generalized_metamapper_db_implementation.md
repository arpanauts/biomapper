# Feature Idea: Generalized metamapper.db Implementation

## Overview
Create a more flexible and generalized implementation of the metamapper database to support diverse biological entity mapping scenarios beyond the current protein-focused implementation.

## Problem Statement
The current metamapper.db implementation is tailored to specific use cases. A more generalized approach would allow for greater flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability as we add support for new entity types (metabolites, genes, etc.) and mapping resources.

## Key Requirements
- Abstract the current database schema to support diverse mapping scenarios
- Create a flexible query interface for heterogeneous data sources
- Implement advanced caching strategies for performance optimization
- Develop a standardized API for database interactions
- Support mapping between different entity types (cross-type mapping)
- Handle composite identifiers systematically rather than with client-specific logic

## Potential Approaches
- Extend the existing schema with more generic entity and relationship types
- Implement a plugin architecture for adding new entity types and mapping resources
- Create abstraction layers that can accommodate various identifier formats and validation rules
- Design migration strategies for existing data

## Dependencies
- Requires insights from the UKBB-Arivale metabolite mapping work
- Should align with the principles in `iterative_mapping_strategy.md`
- Must maintain compatibility with existing `MappingExecutor` workflows

## Success Criteria
- Uniform handling of multiple entity types (proteins, metabolites, genes, etc.)
- Improved code maintainability with reduced client-specific logic
- Flexible configuration for defining new mapping paths without code changes
- Performance equal to or better than the current implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage for various mapping scenarios
