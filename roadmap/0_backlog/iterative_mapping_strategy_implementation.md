# Feature Idea: Comprehensive Iterative Mapping Strategy Implementation

## Overview
Fully implement the principles and approaches outlined in `iterative_mapping_strategy.md` as the central guide for all mapping processes, with special focus on handling many-to-many mapping relationships.

## Problem Statement
While the iterative mapping strategy document outlines a refined approach to entity mapping, not all aspects have been fully implemented in the current system. There's a need to ensure consistent application of these principles across all mapping types, particularly as we add more complex many-to-many mapping scenarios with metabolites.

## Key Requirements
- Ensure all mappers follow the iterative approach described in the strategy document
- Implement consistent handling of many-to-many relationships across all entity types
- Standardize metadata collection for mapping provenance and path details
- Apply consistent canonical mapping selection logic for one-to-many and many-to-many cases
- Support bidirectional reconciliation for all mapping types, not just proteins

## Implementation Focus Areas
- Update `MappingExecutor` to fully support all aspects of the iterative strategy
- Enhance metadata capture to include all recommended fields
- Ensure pipeline phases (forward mapping, reverse mapping, reconciliation) correctly apply the strategy
- Develop reusable components for handling the general cases described in the strategy

## Related Considerations
- Integration with the generalized metamapper.db implementation
- Handling of composite identifiers within the iterative mapping context
- Performance implications of more complex mapping paths
- Testing strategies for validating correctness of many-to-many mapping

## Success Criteria
- All mappers consistently implement the iterative strategy principles
- Improved mapping success rates due to more sophisticated approaches
- Comprehensive metadata that enables analysis of mapping paths and decisions
- Consistent approach to canonical mapping selection across entity types
- Clear documentation of how the implementation realizes the strategy
