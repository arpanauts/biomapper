# Debug UKBB to HPA Protein Mapping Failures

**Core Concept/Problem:**
The mapping process between UKBB protein data and HPA protein data is currently yielding zero successful mappings out of 10 test records. This indicates a critical issue in the mapping configuration, data interpretation, or underlying logic.

**Intended Goal/Benefit:**
Identify and resolve the root causes of the mapping failures to achieve successful and accurate protein ID mapping between UKBB and HPA datasets. This is crucial for the overall Biomapper project's ability to link these two important biological databases.

**Context/Initial Thoughts:**
- Current efforts involve using the `MappingExecutor` and configurations in `populate_metamapper_db.py`.
- The immediate task is to analyze why the `map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` script, when run with a small test set, reports 0 successful mappings.
- This is a sub-task of the broader goal to "Address Low Mapping Success" identified as a critical priority.
- Investigation may involve checking data file paths, UniProt ID matching logic, and client configurations.
