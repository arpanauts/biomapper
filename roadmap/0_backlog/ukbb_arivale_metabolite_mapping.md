# Feature Idea: UKBB-Arivale Metabolite Mapping

## Overview
Develop an MVP approach for mapping between UKBB metabolites and Arivale datasets (both metabolites and clinical lab results) while designing for future generalization.

## Problem Statement
The existing mapping pipeline has been focused on protein mappings. We now need to extend our mapping capabilities to metabolite data, which presents different challenges and identifier systems.

## Key Requirements
- Manual mapping approach for initial MVP implementation
- Support for both UKBB metabolites → Arivale metabolites mapping
- Support for UKBB metabolites → Arivale clinical lab results mapping 
- Consistent with `iterative_mapping_strategy.md` principles
- Consider one-to-many and many-to-many relationship handling
- Retain appropriate metadata for mapping provenance

## Considerations for Future Generalization
- How these manual mappings will inform future `metamapper.db` schema extensions
- Potential reusable mapping paths that could be formalized
- Identifier standardization approaches for metabolites
- Integration with existing `MappingExecutor` framework

## Success Criteria
- Successfully map a significant portion of UKBB metabolites to corresponding Arivale entries
- Document the mapping process for future reference and automation
- Identify patterns and challenges specific to metabolite mapping
- Produce structured output files consistent with protein mapping pipeline
