# Task: Create Unit Tests for `ClientManager`

## Objective
To ensure the reliability of the `ClientManager` class, create comprehensive unit tests. This task focuses specifically on the `ClientManager` component.

## Location for Tests
Add tests to the file: `tests/core/engine_components/test_managers.py`
(Create this file if it doesn't exist).

## `ClientManager` Test Cases

Use `unittest.mock` to mock client classes and their dependencies.

1.  **Test Client Instantiation**: Verify that `get_client` correctly instantiates a client using a valid configuration.
2.  **Test Client Caching**: Call `get_client` multiple times with the same configuration and assert that the same client instance is returned each time.
3.  **Test Different Configurations**: Call `get_client` with different configurations and assert that different client instances are returned.
4.  **Test Invalid Class Path**: Test that `get_client` raises an appropriate error (e.g., `ImportError` or a custom `ConfigurationError`) if the `client_class_path` is invalid.
5.  **Test Missing Configuration**: Test for graceful failure or appropriate errors when the configuration is missing required keys (e.g., `client_class_path`).

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Unit tests for `ClientManager` are implemented in `tests/core/engine_components/test_managers.py`.
*   The test suite achieves high code coverage for `biomapper/core/engine_components/client_manager.py`.
*   All `ClientManager` tests pass successfully.
