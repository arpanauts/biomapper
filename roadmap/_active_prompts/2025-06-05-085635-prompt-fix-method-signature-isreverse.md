# Prompt: Fix Method Signature Mismatch for `is_reverse` Parameter

**Objective:** Resolve the single test failure caused by a method signature mismatch involving an `is_reverse` parameter, likely in `execute_mapping_path.py` or `MappingExecutor`.

**Context:**
The final comprehensive test run (feedback `2025-06-05-085420-feedback-final-comprehensive-test-analysis.md`) identified one test failing due to an API mismatch related to an `is_reverse` parameter. The feedback suggests this is in `execute_mapping_path.py` line 74 or `MappingExecutor._execute_path`.

**Key Task:**

1.  **Identify the Mismatch:**
    *   Locate the call site and the method definition involved.
        *   **Call Site:** The feedback points to `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/execute_mapping_path.py` around line 74, where `self.mapping_executor._execute_path(...)` is likely called.
        *   **Method Definition:** The `_execute_path` method in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`.
    *   Determine if the `_execute_path` method in `MappingExecutor` expects an `is_reverse` parameter that is not being passed by the `ExecuteMappingPathAction`, or if the action is passing `is_reverse` but the method doesn't accept it.

2.  **Resolve the Mismatch:**
    *   **Option A (If `_execute_path` should accept `is_reverse`):**
        *   Modify the definition of `MappingExecutor._execute_path` to accept the `is_reverse` parameter.
        *   Ensure this parameter is then used appropriately within `_execute_path` if its logic needs to differ for reverse paths.
    *   **Option B (If `_execute_path` should NOT accept `is_reverse` and the action shouldn't pass it):**
        *   Remove the `is_reverse` parameter from the call to `self.mapping_executor._execute_path(...)` in `execute_mapping_path.py` (around line 74).
        *   Consider if the concept of `is_reverse` is still needed by the `ExecuteMappingPathAction` or if it was a remnant of a previous design.
    *   **Guidance:** The choice between A and B depends on whether the `MappingExecutor._execute_path` method *fundamentally needs to know* if a path is being executed in reverse for its internal logic. If `is_reverse` is a property of the `MappingPath` object itself (which `_execute_path` likely receives), then passing it as a separate parameter might be redundant.

**Affected Test:**

*   One specific test is failing due to this. The exact test case should be identifiable from the `final_full_integration_test_run_20250605_084500.log` by looking for `TypeError` related to unexpected keyword arguments or missing positional arguments involving `is_reverse` in the call stack mentioned.

**Verification:**

*   After applying the fix, re-run the single affected test.
*   Confirm that the `TypeError` related to the `is_reverse` parameter is resolved and the test passes (or proceeds to a different failure if there are other underlying issues, though this specific error should be gone).

**Deliverables:**

*   The modified Python file(s) (either `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/execute_mapping_path.py` or `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`).
*   A clear explanation of the mismatch and how it was resolved (which option was chosen and why).
*   Confirmation (e.g., pytest console output snippet) that the targeted test no longer fails with the `is_reverse` parameter TypeError.

**Environment:**

*   Assume other test fixes (fixtures, missing strategies) are being addressed separately.
