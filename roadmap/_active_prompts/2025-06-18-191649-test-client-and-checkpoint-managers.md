# Task: Create Unit Tests for `ClientManager` and `CheckpointManager`

## Objective
To ensure the reliability of our refactored components, create comprehensive unit tests for the `ClientManager` and `CheckpointManager` classes. The tests should cover all primary functionalities and edge cases.

## Location for Tests
Create a new test file: `tests/core/engine_components/test_managers.py`

## `ClientManager` Test Cases

Use `unittest.mock` to mock client classes and their dependencies.

1.  **Test Client Instantiation**: Verify that `get_client` correctly instantiates a client using a valid configuration.
2.  **Test Client Caching**: Call `get_client` multiple times with the same configuration and assert that the same client instance is returned each time.
3.  **Test Different Configurations**: Call `get_client` with different configurations and assert that different client instances are returned.
4.  **Test Invalid Class Path**: Test that `get_client` raises an appropriate error (e.g., `ImportError`) if the `client_class_path` is invalid.
5.  **Test Missing Configuration**: Test for graceful failure or appropriate errors when the configuration is missing required keys.

## `CheckpointManager` Test Cases

Use `pytest`'s `tmp_path` fixture to create temporary directories for testing file operations.

1.  **Test Save Checkpoint**: Verify that `save_checkpoint` correctly creates a JSON file with the expected content.
2.  **Test Load Checkpoint**: Save a checkpoint, then use `load_checkpoint` to read it back and assert that the loaded data matches the original data.
3.  **Test Clear Checkpoint**: Verify that `clear_checkpoint` successfully deletes the checkpoint file.
4.  **Test Load Non-existent Checkpoint**: Assert that `load_checkpoint` returns `None` or handles the case gracefully when no checkpoint file exists.
5.  **Test Checkpoint Directory Creation**: Ensure the `CheckpointManager` automatically creates the checkpoint directory if it does not exist.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A new test file `tests/core/engine_components/test_managers.py` is created.
*   The test suite achieves high code coverage for both `client_manager.py` and `checkpoint_manager.py`.
*   All tests pass successfully.
