# Prompt: Comprehensive Integration Test Run and Analysis

**Objective:** Execute the full Biomapper integration test suite to establish a clear baseline of its current status, identify all remaining failures and errors, and verify the impact of recent fixes.

**Context:**
This prompt follows attempts to fix two major categories of integration test issues:
1.  Database unique constraint violations (`UNIQUE constraint failed: mapping_paths.name, mapping_paths.entity_type`), addressed by prompt `2025-06-05-060125-prompt-fix-mapping-path-constraint-violations.md`.
2.  Test interface mismatches, asynchronous code handling issues, and mock behavior problems, addressed by prompt `2025-06-05-060125-prompt-fix-integration-test-interface-async-errors.md` (which had partial success reported in feedback `2025-06-05-070108-feedback-integration-test-fixes.md`).

It is crucial to ensure that the codebase state for this test run includes the **latest successful changes** from both of the above-mentioned efforts.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Ensure Codebase is Up-to-Date:**
    *   Verify that the current working tree includes the complete fixes intended by the resolution of prompt `2025-06-05-060125-prompt-fix-mapping-path-constraint-violations.md` (related to `MappingPath` unique constraints).
    *   Verify that the current working tree includes the successful changes reported in feedback `2025-06-05-070108-feedback-integration-test-fixes.md` (related to `pytest-asyncio` fixtures, `MappingExecutor` session handling, and test assertions in `test_historical_id_mapping.py`).

2.  **Run Full Integration Test Suite:**
    *   Execute the command: `poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v` from the project root.
    *   Capture the complete console output.

3.  **Analyze Test Results:**
    *   Provide a summary: Total tests, Passed, Failed, Errors, Skipped.
    *   For **each** failed test or test with errors:
        *   State the full test name (e.g., `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py::TestYAMLStrategyExecution::test_basic_linear_strategy`).
        *   Provide the primary error message and a snippet of the traceback.
        *   Attempt to categorize the failure (e.g., Database Error, Assertion Error, API Mismatch, Async Issue, Mocking Problem, etc.).

4.  **Verify Specific Previous Issues:**
    Based on the full test run, explicitly report on the status of these previously identified critical issues:
    *   **Database Constraint:** Is the `UNIQUE constraint failed: mapping_paths.name, mapping_paths.entity_type` error (or any variant) still present in `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` or elsewhere?
    *   **Async Handling in `test_yaml_strategy_ukbb_hpa.py`:**
        *   Is the `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'execute_yaml_strategy'` resolved?
        *   Are there any `RuntimeWarning: coroutine ... was never awaited` warnings (especially for `populated_db`)?
    *   **`get_db_manager` Calls:** Is the `TypeError: get_db_manager() got an unexpected keyword argument 'metamapper_db_url'` appearing in any test file?
    *   **`test_historical_id_mapping.py` Mocking:**
        *   Are tests in this file passing? If not, what are the failures (e.g., related to `status` field assertion, or `path_execution_order` being empty)?
        *   Is the `TypeError: setup_mock_endpoints.<locals>.configure() missing 1 required positional argument: 'target_property'` (or similar related to `setup_mock_endpoints`) definitively resolved or still manifesting?

5.  **Provide Full Console Output:**
    *   Include the complete, unabridged console output from the `pytest` command, preferably within a collapsible markdown section (`<details>`).

**Deliverables:**

*   A detailed feedback document structured as follows:
    *   Confirmation of codebase state (mentioning that fixes from previous prompts are assumed to be included).
    *   Test Summary (Total, Passed, Failed, Errors, Skipped).
    *   Detailed Failure Analysis (for each failing/erroring test: name, error, traceback snippet, category).
    *   Verification of Specific Previous Issues (explicit status for each listed item).
    *   Full Pytest Console Output.

**Environment:**

*   Ensure all dependencies are installed using Poetry (`poetry install`).
*   Tests must be run using `pytest` from the project root.
