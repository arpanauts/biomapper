# Task: Correct Strategy Name in UKBB-HPA Pipeline Script

## 1. Task Objective
Update the `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script to use the correct strategy name `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT` as defined in `configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml`.

## 2. Background Context
- The `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script currently has `STRATEGY_NAME = "UKBB_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_STRATEGY"` (due to a previous incorrect modification by Cascade assistant in Step 532).
- The correct strategy name in `configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml` that implements the full bidirectional mapping with the new `StrategyAction` classes (`LoadEndpointIdentifiersAction`, `ReconcileBidirectionalAction`, `SaveBidirectionalResultsAction`) is `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT` (found at line 230 of the YAML).
- This mismatch is the primary reason the pipeline completed but produced no output files, as it was not executing the intended strategy.

## 3. Detailed Plan

1.  **Modify `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`:**
    *   Open `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`.
    *   Locate the line `STRATEGY_NAME = "UKBB_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_STRATEGY"` (this is line 81).
    *   Change it to `STRATEGY_NAME = "UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT"`.
    *   Save the file.

2.  **Re-run Database Population:**
    *   Execute the command: `poetry run python scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py --drop-all`
    *   CWD: `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`

3.  **Re-run the Main Pipeline Script:**
    *   Execute the command: `poetry run python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
    *   CWD: `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`

4.  **Verify Output:**
    *   Check the contents of the directory `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/`.
    *   The `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT` strategy in the YAML configures `SaveBidirectionalResultsAction` with these filenames:
        *   `csv_filename: "ukbb_hpa_bidirectional_reconciled.csv"`
        *   `json_summary_filename: "ukbb_hpa_bidirectional_summary.json"`
    *   Therefore, these are the expected files if mappings are found.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*   The `STRATEGY_NAME` variable in `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` is correctly updated to `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT`.
*   The `populate_metamapper_db.py` script runs successfully.
*   The `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script runs successfully.
*   The output directory `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/` contains the expected `.csv` and `.json` files if mappings were generated. If the directory is still empty, the script's log output should be captured to confirm if the `SaveBidirectionalResultsAction` reported "No reconciled data found to save".

## 5. Implementation Requirements

*   **Input files/data:**
    *   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` (to be modified)
    *   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml` (for reference of the correct strategy name and output filenames)
*   **Expected outputs:**
    *   Modified `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` file.
    *   Confirmation of successful script executions.
    *   List of files in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/` or relevant log output if empty.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions

*   **Script Execution Errors:** If any script fails, capture the full error traceback and output. The most likely error would be if `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT` is *still* not found (e.g., due to a typo in this prompt or the YAML), in which case the exact strategy name from the YAML should be re-verified.
*   **Output Still Missing:** If the output directory remains empty even after the script runs successfully, provide the full log output from `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` to help diagnose if data is reaching the save step. This would then trigger the need for the previously planned debugging prompt (adding logging to `ReconcileBidirectionalAction`).

## 7. Feedback Format

Please provide your feedback in a Markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Feedback: Correct Strategy Name in UKBB-HPA Pipeline Script

## 1. Summary of Actions Taken
- Confirm modification of `STRATEGY_NAME` in `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`.
- Confirm execution of database population and main pipeline script.

## 2. Script Execution Results
- Provide exit codes and any brief, relevant output from the script runs.

## 3. Output Verification
- List files found in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/`.
- If empty, provide key log lines from `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` (especially from `SaveBidirectionalResultsAction`).

## 4. Code Modifications
- Show the diff or relevant line from `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` that was changed.

## 5. Issues Encountered (if any)
- Detail any errors or unexpected behaviors.

## 6. Next Action Recommendation
- Suggest next steps based on the outcome (e.g., "Proceed with further testing/analysis of results" or "Re-activate prompt to debug ReconcileBidirectionalAction if output is still missing").

## 7. Confidence Assessment
- Rate your confidence in the fix and the outcome.
