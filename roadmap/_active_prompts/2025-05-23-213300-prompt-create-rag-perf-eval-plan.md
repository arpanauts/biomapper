# Prompt: Create RAG Performance Evaluation Plan

## Task Description
Create a comprehensive architecture document titled `rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md` to be saved in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/`. This document should outline a detailed plan for evaluating and optimizing the performance of the `PubChemRAGMappingClient`.

The plan must consider:
1.  The currently implemented `PubChemRAGMappingClient` (as summarized in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/pubchem_rag_mapping_client/summary.md`).
2.  Potential future enhancements and more advanced features as detailed in the planning documents located at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_planning/rag_mapping_feature/` (specifically `design.md` and `spec.md`). This includes features like LLM-based adjudication and statistical significance testing for similarity scores.

## Input Files & Context
*   **Current Client Summary:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/pubchem_rag_mapping_client/summary.md`
*   **Advanced RAG Planning - Design:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_planning/rag_mapping_feature/design.md`
*   **Advanced RAG Planning - Specification:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_planning/rag_mapping_feature/spec.md`
*   **Latest Status Update (for context on RAG client):** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-23-210820-session-summary.md` (particularly "Open Questions & Considerations")

## Key Areas to Cover in the Plan
*   **Metrics:** Define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as precision, recall, F1-score, mean reciprocal rank, latency per query, batch throughput, and resource utilization.
*   **Benchmarking:**
    *   Identify or propose creation of suitable benchmarking datasets (e.g., gold-standard metabolite mappings).
    *   Outline a methodology for running benchmarks against these datasets.
*   **Threshold Tuning:** Detail strategies for optimizing the similarity score threshold for the current client, including methods to evaluate the impact of different thresholds on KPIs.
*   **Statistical Significance:** Incorporate plans to evaluate the statistical significance measures for similarity scores (as mentioned in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_planning/rag_mapping_feature/design.md`) and how these could be tuned or used.
*   **Caching Strategies:** Propose methods to evaluate the effectiveness of potential caching mechanisms for queries or embeddings.
*   **LLM Adjudication Impact (Future):** If LLM adjudication (from the advanced plan) were to be implemented, how would its performance and impact on accuracy be evaluated?
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Plan for comparing different configurations (e.g., various thresholds, with/without statistical filtering, eventually with/without LLM).
*   **Tools and Logging:** What tools, logging, or instrumentation would be needed to support this evaluation?

## Expected Output
*   A new Markdown file: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md`.
    *   Ensure the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/` directory is created if it doesn't exist.
*   The document should be well-structured, clear, and actionable.

## Feedback
Upon completion, create a feedback file in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-rag-perf-eval-plan.md` (use UTC timestamp for feedback generation time). The feedback should summarize the work done, link to the created document, and note any challenges or assumptions made.
