# Task: Implement FAISSVectorStore Functionality

## 1. Context
The Biomapper project requires a robust vector store for managing and querying embeddings. Currently, the `biomapper.embedder.storage.vector_store.py` file contains a placeholder `FAISSVectorStore` class. This task is to fully implement this class using the FAISS library to provide efficient similarity search capabilities.

This implementation is crucial for functionalities that rely on comparing vector embeddings, such as finding similar entities based on their semantic representations. The current placeholder status (Memory `a0ba9a30-a906-434a-aea0-9224dc55f3dd`) blocks these features.

## 2. Objective
To fully implement the `FAISSVectorStore` class in `biomapper/embedder/storage/vector_store.py`, enabling storage, retrieval, and similarity search of vector embeddings using the FAISS library.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  The `FAISSVectorStore` class is implemented with methods for adding embeddings, saving/loading the index, and performing similarity searches.
2.  The implementation correctly utilizes the FAISS library for all core vector operations.
3.  The class includes appropriate error handling and logging.
4.  Basic unit tests are provided to verify the core functionality (add, search, save, load).
5.  The implementation is compatible with Python 3.11 and the project's Poetry environment.

## 3. Key Steps & Expected Outcomes

1.  **Initialize FAISS Index:**
    *   Implement the `__init__` method to initialize a FAISS index. Allow for configuration of index type (e.g., `IndexFlatL2`, `IndexIVFFlat`) and dimensionality.
    *   Handle persistence: The constructor should allow creating a new index or loading an existing one from a specified file path.

2.  **Add Embeddings:**
    *   Implement a method (e.g., `add_embeddings(self, embeddings: np.ndarray, ids: List[str])`) to add a batch of embeddings (NumPy arrays) and their corresponding identifiers to the FAISS index.
    *   Ensure identifiers are mapped to FAISS index positions.

3.  **Similarity Search:**
    *   Implement a method (e.g., `search(self, query_embedding: np.ndarray, k: int) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]`) to find the `k` most similar embeddings to a given query embedding.
    *   The method should return a list of (identifier, similarity_score/distance) tuples.

4.  **Save and Load Index:**
    *   Implement methods to save the current FAISS index and associated ID mappings to disk (e.g., `save(self, index_path: str)`).
    *   Implement methods to load a previously saved FAISS index and ID mappings from disk (e.g., `load(cls, index_path: str)` as a class method or part of `__init__`).

5.  **Helper Methods (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   A method to get the number of embeddings currently in the store.
    *   A method to remove embeddings (if feasible and required, FAISS has limitations here).

6.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Integrate standard Python logging for important operations and errors.
    *   Implement robust error handling (e.g., for file I/O, FAISS-specific errors).

7.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   Create basic unit tests in `tests/embedder/storage/` covering:
        *   Index creation.
        *   Adding embeddings.
        *   Searching for similar embeddings (verify results with known data).
        *   Saving and loading the index.

## 4. Current State & Relevant Files
*   **File to Modify:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/embedder/storage/vector_store.py` (currently contains a placeholder class).
*   **Potential Test File Location:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/embedder/storage/test_vector_store.py` (may need to be created).
*   **Key Dependency:** `faiss-cpu` (or `faiss-gpu` if GPU support is intended and available, but `faiss-cpu` is a safer default). Ensure this is in `pyproject.toml`.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
*   **Input files/data:** N/A for core implementation, but unit tests will require sample embeddings.
*   **Expected outputs:** A fully functional `FAISSVectorStore` class and associated unit tests.
*   **Code standards:** Adhere to Biomapper project coding standards (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings).
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Primarily `faiss-cpu` and `numpy`.
    *   Verify `faiss-cpu` is listed as a project dependency in `pyproject.toml`. If not, the first step should be to add it using `poetry add faiss-cpu`.
*   **Validation requirements:** Unit tests passing, demonstration of basic add/search/save/load functionality.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
*   **FAISS Installation Issues:** If `faiss-cpu` is not installed or causes issues, ensure the environment is clean and try `poetry add faiss-cpu`. Consult FAISS documentation for platform-specific troubleshooting.
*   **FAISS API Usage Errors:** Refer to the official FAISS documentation and examples for correct API usage. Pay attention to data types (e.g., FAISS expects float32 NumPy arrays).
*   **Serialization Issues:** Saving/loading FAISS indexes can be tricky. Use `faiss.write_index()` and `faiss.read_index()`. ID mappings will need separate serialization (e.g., using JSON or pickle).

## 7. Feedback Format
*   **Commands Executed:** Any commands run (e.g., `poetry add`, `pytest`).
*   **Code Changes:** A diff or summary of changes to `vector_store.py` and any test files.
*   **Unit Test Results:** Output from `pytest`.
*   **Completed Subtasks:** Checklist of "Key Steps" completed.
*   **Issues Encountered:** Detailed descriptions of any problems and how they were (or were not) resolved.
*   **Next Action Recommendation:** e.g., "Ready for integration testing," or "Further work needed on X."
*   **Confidence Assessment:** High/Medium/Low regarding the completeness and correctness of the implementation.
*   **Environment Changes:** e.g., "Added faiss-cpu to pyproject.toml."
*   **Lessons Learned:** Any insights.
