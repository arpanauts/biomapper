# Task: Decompose Result Aggregation from `execute_mapping`

## 1. Task Objective
Extract the final result aggregation and bundling logic from the end of the `MappingExecutor.execute_mapping` method into a new, dedicated service. This service will be responsible for taking the raw mapping results and packaging them into the final `MappingResultBundle`.

## 2. Context and Background
After the mapping iterations in `execute_mapping` are complete, there is a block of code that collects all the mapped and unmapped identifiers, calculates summary statistics, and constructs the `MappingResultBundle` object. This is a distinct responsibility that can be cleanly separated from the mapping execution logic itself.

## 3. Key Memories and Documents
- **Source File:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
- **Result Model:** `biomapper/core/models/result_bundle.py`
- **Starter Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_starter_prompt.md`

## 4. Success Criteria
- A new service class (e.g., `ResultAggregationService`) is created in a new file under `biomapper/core/services/`.
- This service takes the various collections of mapped and unmapped data as input and is solely responsible for creating the `MappingResultBundle`.
- The `MappingExecutor.execute_mapping` method is simplified by delegating the final result bundling to this new service.
- The `execute_mapping` method's return signature will now directly return the `MappingResultBundle` produced by the new service.
- All tests that inspect the contents of the `MappingResultBundle` must pass.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
- **Input files/data:** `mapping_executor.py`
- **Expected outputs:** A new service file (e.g., `biomapper/core/services/result_aggregation_service.py`) and a modified `mapping_executor.py`.
- **Code standards:** The new service should be stateless, taking all necessary data as arguments to its primary method.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
- Ensure the data structures passed to the new service (e.g., dictionaries of mapped results) are in the expected format.
- Mismatches in the final `MappingResultBundle` are likely due to incorrect data being passed to the new service. Verify the inputs at the boundary between the executor and the aggregator.

## 7. Feedback and Reporting
- **File Path:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-refactor-executor-result-aggregation.md`
- **Content:**
    - **Completed Subtasks:** Report on the creation of the new service and the simplification of `execute_mapping`.
    - **Issues Encountered:** Note any difficulties in separating the aggregation logic.
    - **Next Action Recommendation:** Confirm that the `execute_mapping` method is now fully decomposed.
    - **Confidence Assessment:** High. This is a straightforward extraction of data transformation logic.
