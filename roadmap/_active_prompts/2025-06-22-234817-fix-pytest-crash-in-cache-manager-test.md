# Prompt: Fix Pytest Crash in TestCacheManager by Correctly Mocking ReversiblePath

**Task Objective:**
Resolve a `pytest` crash occurring in `tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`. The crash happens during the `test_store_mapping_results_with_reverse_path` test due to an improper mock of the `ReversiblePath` object. The goal is to replace the inadequate `MagicMock` with a correctly configured mock that accurately represents a `ReversiblePath` instance, ensuring the test suite runs to completion without errors.

**Prerequisites:**
- The project codebase is accessible at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/`.
- You have permissions to read and modify files within this directory.
- `pytest` and project dependencies are installed in the environment.

**Input Context:**
- **Failing Test File:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`
- **Class with Failing Test:** `TestCacheManagerStoreResults`
- **Specific Crashing Test:** `test_store_mapping_results_with_reverse_path`
- **Class Definition for Mocking:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/reversible_path.py` (The `ReversiblePath` class)
- **Method Under Test:** `store_mapping_results` in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/cache_manager.py`
- **Pytest Output Log:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/pytest_output.txt` (shows the crash occurs after `test_store_mapping_results_success`)

**Expected Outputs:**
- A modified version of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py` where the `test_store_mapping_results_with_reverse_path` test uses a correct mock for `ReversiblePath`.
- A successful, error-free execution of the `pytest` command on the modified test file.

**Success Criteria:**
- Running `pytest tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py` completes successfully with all tests passing, and the previously observed crash is gone.

**Error Recovery Instructions:**
- If the fix introduces new test failures, analyze the `pytest` error output to understand the new issue.
- Revert the changes to the test file if the new approach is flawed.
- Re-examine the `ReversiblePath` class and the `store_mapping_results` method to ensure all accessed attributes of the `path` object are correctly mocked.

**Environment Requirements:**
- Python environment with all `biomapper` project dependencies installed.
- Tools: `pytest`, standard shell commands.

**Task Decomposition:**
1.  **Import Necessary Classes:** In `tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`, ensure that `ReversiblePath` from `biomapper.core.engine_components.reversible_path` and `MappingPath` from `biomapper.db.models` are imported.
2.  **Locate the Failing Test:** Find the `test_store_mapping_results_with_reverse_path` method within the `TestCacheManagerStoreResults` class.
3.  **Analyze the Current Mock:** The current implementation uses `mock_path = MagicMock()`. This is the source of the problem. The `store_mapping_results` method expects the `path` object to have specific attributes and properties that `MagicMock` does not provide, especially those accessed via `__getattr__` in the `ReversiblePath` class.
4.  **Construct a Proper Mock:**
    - First, create a `MagicMock` instance to represent the `original_path`, which is expected to be a `MappingPath` object. Configure this mock with the necessary attributes that will be accessed during the test. These include `id`, `name`, `steps`, and `priority`.
    - Example `original_path` mock setup:
      ```python
      mock_original_path = MagicMock(spec=MappingPath)
      mock_original_path.id = 123
      mock_original_path.name = "test_path"
      mock_original_path.steps = ["step1"]
      mock_original_path.priority = 50
      ```
    - Next, create a *real* instance of `ReversiblePath`, passing the `mock_original_path` to its constructor and setting `is_reverse=True`.
    - Example `ReversiblePath` instance:
      ```python
      mock_path = ReversiblePath(original_path=mock_original_path, is_reverse=True)
      ```
5.  **Replace the Old Mock:** Replace the line `mock_path = MagicMock()` with the new, correctly constructed `mock_path` instance.
6.  **Validate the Fix:** Execute `pytest tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py` from the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper` directory and confirm that it passes without crashing.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- After modifying the test, ensure the `ReversiblePath` is instantiated correctly with a mocked `MappingPath`.
- After running `pytest`, verify that the output shows all tests in the file passed and no crash occurred.

**Source Prompt Reference:**
`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-22-234817-fix-pytest-crash-in-cache-manager-test.md`

**Context from Previous Attempts:**
This is the first attempt. The investigation has concluded that the crash is due to the insufficient mocking of the `ReversiblePath` object, which has complex attribute access patterns (properties and `__getattr__`) not handled by a simple `MagicMock`.
