# Task: Implement Unit Tests for the CacheManager Service

## 1. Objective

Create a new, comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `CacheManager` service. The original cache-related tests were part of the monolithic `MappingExecutor` tests and were removed during refactoring, with the intention of creating a dedicated test suite for the new service.

## 2. Context and Background

The `CacheManager` service is responsible for handling the caching of mapping results to avoid redundant computations. During the core executor test refactoring (see feedback `2025-06-22-000233-feedback-refactor-core-executor-tests.md`), the tests for this functionality were deferred. A placeholder file may exist at `tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`. This task is to implement the deferred tests and ensure the `CacheManager` is robust and reliable.

## 3. Prerequisites

- The agent must understand the public API and purpose of the `CacheManager` service.
- Proficiency in testing stateful services and using `unittest.mock` is required.

## 4. Task Breakdown

1.  **Locate or Create the Test File:**
    - Find the test file at `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`. If it doesn't exist, create it.

2.  **Review the `CacheManager` Implementation:**
    - Open `biomapper/core/engine_components/cache_manager.py` to understand its public methods (e.g., `check_cache`, `cache_results`) and dependencies.

3.  **Implement Unit Tests:**
    - Create a `setup` method or fixture to initialize a `CacheManager` instance for each test.
    - **Test `check_cache`:**
        - Write a test to verify that `check_cache` returns `None` for an identifier that is not in the cache.
        - Write a test to verify that `check_cache` correctly returns the cached data for an identifier that has been previously cached.
    - **Test `cache_results`:**
        - Write a test to verify that after calling `cache_results`, the corresponding data can be retrieved by `check_cache`.
    - **Test Cache Structure:**
        - Write a test to ensure the data is cached in the expected format.
    - **Test Edge Cases:**
        - Test caching and retrieving empty results (`[]`).
        - Test caching and retrieving `None` values if that is a valid use case.

## 5. Implementation Requirements

- **Target File:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`
- **Code Standards:** All tests must be `async def` and use `pytest` and `unittest.mock`. Follow existing project conventions.

## 6. Validation and Success Criteria

- **Success:** A new test suite for `CacheManager` is created, and all tests within it pass.
- **Validation Command:** `poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/engine_components/test_cache_manager.py`

## 7. Feedback and Reporting

- Provide the full content of the new `test_cache_manager.py` file.
- Provide the output of the `pytest` run to confirm all tests pass.
