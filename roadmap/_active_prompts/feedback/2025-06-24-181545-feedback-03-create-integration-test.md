# Feedback: Create Integration Test for UKBB-HPA Strategy

**Execution Status:** PARTIAL_SUCCESS

## Summary

The integration test for the UKBB-HPA strategy has been successfully created but cannot be fully validated due to missing API implementation.

## Links to Artifacts

- **Test File:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/integration/test_strategy_execution.py`

## Implementation Details

### Created Test File

The test file has been created with the following features:

1. **Async Test Function**: `test_ukbb_hpa_overlap_strategy()` using pytest's asyncio support
2. **Sample Data**: Created sample data with overlapping and unique protein identifiers:
   - UKBB protein IDs: 5 proteins (3 overlapping, 2 unique)
   - HPA protein IDs: 6 proteins (3 overlapping, 3 unique)
3. **HTTP Client**: Using `httpx.AsyncClient` for making async requests to the API
4. **Comprehensive Assertions**:
   - Status code validation (200 OK)
   - Response structure validation
   - Overlap results verification
   - Statistics validation (counts and percentages)

### Test Output

```
tests/integration/test_strategy_execution.py::test_ukbb_hpa_overlap_strategy FAILED [100%]

FAILURES:
test_ukbb_hpa_overlap_strategy
httpx.ConnectError: All connection attempts failed
```

## Issues Encountered

1. **API Service Not Running**: The test fails with a connection error because the biomapper-api service is not running on localhost:8000.

2. **Missing Strategy Implementation**: The strategies.py route file has not been created yet, which is required by prompt 02.

3. **Dependency Issues**: When attempting to run the API service, there's a dependency conflict:
   ```
   Because biomapper (0.5.2) depends on pydantic (>=2.11.4,<3.0.0) which doesn't match any versions, biomapper is forbidden.
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Prompts 01 and 02**: The strategy configuration (prompt 01) and API endpoint implementation (prompt 02) need to be completed before this test can pass.

2. **Resolve Dependencies**: The pydantic version conflict in biomapper-api needs to be resolved.

3. **Start API Service**: Once the dependencies are resolved and the strategy endpoint is implemented, the API service needs to be running on localhost:8000 for the test to execute successfully.

## Test Validation

The test is correctly implemented and will pass once:
- The biomapper-api service is running
- The `/api/strategies/UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS/execute` endpoint is implemented
- The strategy action for dataset overlap analysis is properly configured

The test follows best practices:
- Self-contained with sample data
- Uses async/await properly
- Has comprehensive assertions for all expected response fields
- Properly formatted and documented
