# Feedback: Evaluate and Adapt Starter Prompt for Service-Oriented Architecture

**Execution Status:** COMPLETE_SUCCESS

## Completed Subtasks

- [x] Analyzed existing `_starter_prompt.md` file to identify sections needing updates for SOA
- [x] Created new `_soa_starter_prompt.md` with comprehensive SOA-focused guidance
- [x] Analyzed `ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb` notebook to understand the workflow
- [x] Created `notebook_to_service_plan.md` with detailed conversion plan
- [x] Generated this feedback document

## Issues Encountered

No significant issues were encountered during task execution. All files were found and accessible as expected.

## Task Details

### 1. Analysis of Original Starter Prompt

The original `_starter_prompt.md` contained guidance focused on:
- Direct code implementation within the biomapper library
- StrategyAction development for monolithic execution
- Claude Code instance prompts for file-based development
- Pipeline scripts in `scripts/main_pipelines/`

Key outdated sections identified:
- No mention of API service layer
- Strategy execution assumed local/monolithic context
- No guidance on service integration patterns
- Missing UI component considerations

### 2. New SOA Starter Prompt

Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_soa_starter_prompt.md` with:
- Clear introduction to the three-tier architecture (biomapper, biomapper-api, biomapper-ui)
- API-first development principles
- Service-compatible StrategyAction guidelines
- API endpoint documentation
- Service deployment workflow
- Enhanced prompt templates for service tasks
- Notebook-to-service conversion guidance

Key additions:
- **Service Architecture Overview**: Explains the role of each component
- **API Integration Guide**: Documents available endpoints and workflows
- **Service-Oriented StrategyAction Guide**: Emphasizes stateless, async-compatible actions
- **YAML Strategy Definitions**: Shows API configuration sections
- **Service Deployment Workflow**: Outlines the path from development to production

### 3. Notebook Analysis

The `ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb` notebook revealed:
- Complex multi-step protein mapping workflow
- Direct use of biomapper library components
- UniProt historical resolution requirements
- Overlap analysis between datasets
- Attempts to use both direct mapping and pipeline strategies

Key observations:
- Notebook performs data loading, ID extraction, resolution, and analysis
- Contains database initialization issues that prevented full pipeline execution
- Demonstrates the need for proper error handling and progress tracking

### 4. Notebook-to-Service Conversion Plan

Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/notebook_to_service_plan.md` with:
- Comprehensive analysis of current notebook functionality
- Proposed service architecture with new API endpoints
- Four new StrategyAction implementations required
- Complete YAML strategy definition for service execution
- Four-phase implementation plan with timelines
- API usage examples with curl commands
- Benefits and migration considerations

The plan provides a clear path to convert the notebook's functionality into:
- Reusable StrategyActions
- API endpoints for file upload and mapping execution
- Asynchronous job processing with progress tracking
- Comprehensive result reporting

## Next Action Recommendation

1. **Review and Approve Documents**: Have the USER review both new documents for alignment with project vision
2. **Prioritize StrategyAction Development**: Begin implementing the four core actions identified in the conversion plan
3. **Update API Routes**: Extend biomapper-api with strategy execution endpoints
4. **Create Integration Tests**: Develop tests that validate the notebook-to-service conversion produces identical results
5. **Document API Changes**: Update OpenAPI schemas and documentation

## Links to Artifacts

1. **New SOA Starter Prompt**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_soa_starter_prompt.md`
2. **Notebook-to-Service Plan**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/notebook_to_service_plan.md`

## Summary

The task has been completed successfully. The new service-oriented starter prompt provides comprehensive guidance for developing within the Biomapper SOA framework, emphasizing API-first design, stateless execution, and proper service integration. The notebook conversion plan offers a concrete example of how to transform existing notebook-based workflows into scalable, production-ready services. Together, these documents establish a foundation for consistent service-oriented development across the Biomapper platform.
