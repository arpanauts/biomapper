# Feedback: Fix Poetry Client Install Issue

**Task Reference:** Debug Persistent Poetry Dependency Installation Failure
**Execution Date:** 2025-06-25T11:53:03
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

The issue had two main root causes:

### Primary Cause: Corrupted Virtual Environment
The `.venv` directory in the project root was corrupted with mixed ownership between root and ubuntu users, pointing to a root-owned Python installation (`/root/.pyenv/versions/3.11.13/bin/python3.11`). This prevented Poetry from properly managing the environment.

### Secondary Cause: Missing Export Declarations
The `biomapper_client` package's `__init__.py` file was not exporting the `ApiError` and `NetworkError` classes that the script was trying to import. Only `BiomapperClient` was exported in the `__all__` list.

## 2. Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Remove Corrupted Virtual Environment
```bash
sudo rm -rf /home/ubuntu/biomapper/.venv
```

### Step 2: Create Fresh Poetry Environment
```bash
poetry env use python3.11
# This created a new environment at: /home/ubuntu/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/biomapper-OD08x7G7-py3.11
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

### Step 4: Fix Missing Exports
Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper_client/biomapper_client/__init__.py`:
```python
from .client import BiomapperClient, ApiError, NetworkError

__version__ = "0.1.0"
__all__ = ["BiomapperClient", "ApiError", "NetworkError"]
```

## 3. Verification

After these fixes:
- `poetry show | grep biomapper-client` correctly shows: `biomapper-client 0.1.0`
- The script runs without ImportError
- The error now is the expected "API service not running" error, confirming the client is working

## 4. Key Learnings

1. **Virtual Environment Ownership**: When Poetry environments have permission issues, it's often better to completely remove and recreate them rather than trying to fix permissions.

2. **Poetry Environment Location**: Poetry doesn't always create the `.venv` in the project root. It may use a centralized cache location like `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/`.

3. **Package Export Declarations**: When creating a Python package, ensure all public classes/functions are properly exported in `__init__.py` and listed in `__all__`.

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Avoid Root Operations**: The corrupted venv with root ownership suggests some operations were run with sudo. Always use Poetry commands as the regular user.

2. **Package Structure**: The current nested Poetry project structure (biomapper containing biomapper_client) works but can be fragile. Consider documenting the proper installation process.

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated tests that verify the client package can be imported to catch these issues early.

## 6. Final Status

✅ The script `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` now executes without ImportError
✅ The `biomapper-client` package is properly installed and importable
✅ The fix is stable and follows Python packaging best practices

The issue is fully resolved.
