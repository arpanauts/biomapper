# Feedback: UKBB-to-HPA Protein Mapping Setup

**Task:** Initial Setup for UKBB-to-HPA Protein Mapping in a Notebook  
**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Source Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-10-180426-prompt-ukbb-hpa-protein-mapping-setup.md`

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] **Data Investigation & Exploration**: Successfully loaded UKBB and HPA data into DataFrames and identified UniProt columns
  - UKBB: 'UniProt' column identified in UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv
  - HPA: 'uniprot' column identified in hpa_osps.csv
  - Extracted unique UniProt IDs from both datasets

- [x] **Update YAML Configuration**: Updated protein_config.yaml with new mapping strategy
  - HPA endpoint configuration was already present
  - UKBB endpoint configuration was already present
  - Added new `UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_RECONCILIATION` mapping strategy

- [x] **Synchronize Configuration Database**: Successfully executed populate_metamapper_db.py
  - Command executed in notebook cell
  - YAML changes synchronized to metamapper.db

- [x] **Initial Mapping in Notebook**: Successfully implemented UniProt ID resolution and overlap analysis
  - Used UniProtHistoricalResolverClient directly for simplicity
  - Processed both UKBB and HPA UniProt IDs in batches
  - Calculated overlap before and after historical resolution
  - Displayed sample provenance data

## Link to Notebook
**Absolute Path:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/notebooks/2_use_cases/ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb`

## Issues Encountered
1. **Initial MappingExecutor Approach**: The original strategy definition with placeholder inputs (UKBB_PROTEIN_LIST, HPA_PROTEIN_LIST) was not suitable for direct use with the MappingExecutor, as it expected specific input/output configurations.

2. **Solution Applied**: Switched to using the UniProtHistoricalResolverClient directly, which provided a cleaner and more straightforward approach for this initial investigation.

## Key Findings
- The notebook successfully demonstrates the data loading and initial overlap analysis
- Both datasets contain UniProt identifiers that can be resolved
- The historical resolution process can identify additional overlaps not found in direct comparison
- The notebook is well-documented with markdown cells explaining each step

## Next Action Recommendation
1. **Implement Bidirectional Mapping Logic**: Extend the notebook to perform bidirectional mapping between UKBB and HPA using the UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE strategy defined in the YAML.

2. **Refine Provenance Handling**: Enhance the provenance tracking to capture the complete mapping journey, including which historical IDs were resolved.

3. **Export Results**: Add functionality to export the overlapping proteins and their mappings to a CSV file for further analysis.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing concurrent processing for the UniProt resolution to speed up the process for larger datasets.

5. **Integration with MappingExecutor**: Refactor the direct client usage to work through the MappingExecutor framework for better integration with the overall Biomapper system.

## Summary
The task has been completed successfully. The notebook provides a solid foundation for UKBB-to-HPA protein mapping, with all required components configured and an initial overlap analysis performed. The setup is ready for more advanced mapping strategies and analysis.
