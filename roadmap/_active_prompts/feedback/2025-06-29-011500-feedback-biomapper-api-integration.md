  - [x] Verified fix with standalone test script

## Issues Encountered

### 1. **Strategy Database Dependency**
- **Issue**: Biomapper engine expects strategies in database, but API loads from YAML
- **Resolution**: Created script to populate database with YAML strategy
- **Impact**: Adds deployment complexity

### 2. **Endpoint Not Found**
- **Issue**: Strategy execution required endpoints in database
- **Resolution**: Created script to populate required endpoints
- **Impact**: Additional setup step required

### 3. **Context Key Mismatch**
- **Issue**: LOCAL_ID_CONVERTER expected `input_identifiers` but context had only `initial_identifiers`
- **Resolution**: Modified StrategyOrchestrator to include both keys
- **Impact**: Fixed "empty_input" error

### 4. **Missing Action Type**
- **Issue**: Strategy uses `POPULATE_CONTEXT_FROM_FILE` action which doesn't exist
- **Resolution**: Not resolved - blocks full execution
- **Impact**: Pipeline cannot complete

### 5. **API Reload Issues**
- **Issue**: FastAPI `--reload` didn't pick up changes in imported modules
- **Resolution**: Full restart required
- **Impact**: Slower development cycle

## Next Action Recommendation

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Implement Missing Action**: Create `POPULATE_CONTEXT_FROM_FILE` action or use existing alternative
2. **Validate Strategy**: Check all action types exist before execution
3. **Test Full Pipeline**: Run end-to-end test once action is available

### Future Improvements:
1. **Hybrid Strategy Loading**: Allow executing YAML strategies without database population
2. **Action Discovery**: Implement dynamic action loading to avoid hardcoded dispatch
3. **Better Error Messages**: Provide actionable guidance for missing dependencies
4. **Deployment Scripts**: Create setup scripts that populate all required data

## Confidence Assessment
- **Code Quality**: HIGH - Changes follow existing patterns and are well-structured
- **Testing Coverage**: MEDIUM - Direct tests pass but full integration blocked
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Database dependencies add complexity

## Environment Changes

### Files Created:
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_yaml_strategy.py` - Populates strategies into database
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_endpoints.py` - Creates required endpoints
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/test_context_fix.py` - Verifies context initialization
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-29-refactor-strategy-execution-api-prompt.md`
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-29-fix-context-initialization-prompt.md`

### Files Modified:
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py` - Real executor integration
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/models/strategy.py` - New request model
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/api/routes/strategies.py` - Updated route handler
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper_client/biomapper_client/client.py` - Direct context passing
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` - New request format
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/strategy_orchestrator.py` - Context fix

### Database Changes:
- Added UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS strategy with 4 steps
- Added UKBB_PROTEIN_ASSAY_ID and HPA_GENE_NAME endpoints

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Architecture Mismatch**
The biomapper engine and API have different assumptions about strategy storage. The engine expects database-backed strategies while the API loads from YAML. This fundamental mismatch needs architectural resolution.

### 2. **Dependency Validation**
Strategies can reference non-existent action types. Need pre-execution validation to catch these errors early.

### 3. **Context Key Conventions**
Different parts of the system use different naming conventions (`input_identifiers` vs `initial_identifiers`). Need standardization.

### 4. **Testing Strategy**
Creating standalone test scripts helps isolate issues from API-specific problems. This approach proved valuable for debugging.

### 5. **Async Patterns**
FastAPI's async context requires careful handling when integrating with async libraries. Deferring initialization until first use avoids event loop conflicts.

### 6. **Error Propagation**
The multi-layer architecture (API → Strategy Coordinator → YAML Execution Service → Strategy Orchestrator) makes error messages verbose but informative.

## Summary

Successfully integrated the real biomapper engine into the API service, replacing all mock functionality. The integration works but is blocked by a missing action type. The session revealed important architectural mismatches that should be addressed for a production-ready system. Despite the blocking issue, the foundational work is complete and the system is positioned for successful execution once the missing action is implemented.
