# Feedback: Evaluate and Adapt Starter Prompt for Service-Oriented Architecture

**Execution Status:** COMPLETE_SUCCESS

**Completed Subtasks:**
- [X] Confirmed that the new meta-prompt, `_soa_starter_prompt.md`, aligns with the project's service-oriented architecture.
- [X] Confirmed that the detailed conversion plan, `notebook_to_service_plan.md`, exists and outlines the steps for converting the notebook PoC to a service-based workflow.

**Issues Encountered:**
- The initial prompt file suggested by `_suggested_next_prompt.md` was not found. This was resolved by listing the contents of the `_active_prompts` directory and identifying the correct, most recent task file.
- An attempt was made to create `notebook_to_service_plan.md` without first checking for its existence. This was corrected by reading the existing file's content.

**Next Action Recommendation:**
- Begin implementation of the plan outlined in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/notebook_to_service_plan.md`. The next logical step is to generate a new prompt for a developer agent to begin "Phase 1: Core Development," starting with the implementation of the `CompositeIdSplitter` and `DatasetOverlapAnalyzer` `StrategyAction` classes.
