# Feedback: RAG Performance Evaluation Plan Creation

## Task Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive RAG performance evaluation plan as requested in the prompt `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-23-213300-prompt-create-rag-perf-eval-plan.md`.

## Work Completed

1. **Document Created**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md`
   - Created the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/` directory (it did not exist)
   - Wrote a comprehensive 12-section evaluation plan (~350 lines)

2. **Key Sections Included**:
   - Executive Summary and Introduction
   - Detailed KPIs (accuracy, performance, and operational metrics)
   - Comprehensive benchmarking strategy with gold standard dataset design
   - Threshold optimization approaches including statistical significance testing
   - Caching strategy evaluation framework
   - LLM adjudication impact analysis (for future implementation)
   - Comparative analysis framework with configuration matrix
   - Implementation tools and infrastructure requirements
   - 4-phase implementation roadmap (8 weeks)
   - Success criteria and risk mitigation strategies

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Metrics Selection**: Chose standard IR metrics (precision, recall, F1, MRR) plus operational metrics relevant to production deployment

2. **Statistical Significance**: Incorporated the mathematical formulas from the advanced RAG planning documents for calculating statistically significant cosine similarity thresholds

3. **Practical Focus**: Balanced theoretical completeness with practical implementation guidance, including code examples and proposed tool structures

4. **Future-Proofing**: Included sections on LLM adjudication evaluation even though it's not yet implemented, based on the advanced planning documents

## Assumptions Made

1. **Gold Standard Dataset Size**: Proposed 1,100 total entries across categories, which should be sufficient for statistically meaningful evaluation

2. **Performance Targets**: Set based on current baseline (70-90 QPS) with reasonable improvement goals

3. **Implementation Timeline**: Estimated 8 weeks for full evaluation implementation, which may need adjustment based on resource availability

## Challenges Encountered

No significant challenges - all required context documents were accessible and provided clear guidance for the plan structure.

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. Review and approve the evaluation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation with gold standard dataset creation
3. Set up the metrics collection infrastructure
4. Run initial baseline benchmarks to validate the evaluation framework
