## Summary of Changes

### Created GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

Successfully created a comprehensive CI pipeline with the following configuration:

**Workflow Name:** Biomapper CI

**Triggers:**
- Push events to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull request events targeting `main` or `master` branches

**Job Configuration:**
- Single job named `test`
- Runs on `ubuntu-latest` runner
- Uses Python 3.11

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Checkout Repository** - Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to fetch the code
2. **Set up Python** - Uses `actions/setup-python@v4` to install Python 3.11
3. **Install Poetry** - Uses `snok/install-poetry@v1` for dependency management
4. **Cache Dependencies** - Implements caching for Poetry virtual environment to speed up builds
5. **Install Dependencies** - Installs dependencies for both:
   - Core `biomapper` library (from root directory)
   - `biomapper-api` service (from biomapper-api directory)
6. **Run Tests** - Executes `pytest` through Poetry to run the entire test suite

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Poetry Integration**: Since the project uses Poetry for dependency management, the workflow properly installs and uses Poetry
- **Dependency Caching**: Implements caching based on the poetry.lock file hash to speed up subsequent runs
- **Multi-package Support**: Handles dependencies for both the main biomapper package and the biomapper-api service
- **Proper Virtual Environment**: Uses Poetry's virtual environment management for isolated dependencies

### Notes:
- The workflow supports both `main` and `master` branch names for flexibility
- The biomapper-api service has a local path dependency to the main biomapper package, which is properly handled
- Tests are run from the root directory to discover all tests across the project
