# Feedback: Resolve Critical API Startup Failure and Validate Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-06-28 23:27:00
**Task:** Resolve ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper-api service
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Root Cause Analysis

The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.api'` occurred because:

1. The API code is in a separate directory `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/` with its own `pyproject.toml`
2. The API structure uses `app.main:app` not `biomapper.api.main:app`
3. The biomapper dependency was commented out in the biomapper-api's `pyproject.toml`

The issue was in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/pyproject.toml` where the line:
```toml
# biomapper = {path = "../", develop = true}
```
needed to be uncommented to properly link the biomapper core library.

## Integration Test Results

✅ **API Service Started Successfully**
- Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Health endpoint confirmed: `{"status":"healthy","version":"0.1.0"}`
- MapperService initialized with 2 strategies loaded

✅ **End-to-End Pipeline Executed Successfully**
- Script: `scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
- Strategy: `UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS`
- Results: Mock execution completed with protein ID overlap analysis

## Final pyproject.toml Configuration

The corrected `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.11,<4.0"
fastapi = ">=0.104.1"
uvicorn = ">=0.24.0"
pydantic = "^2.11.4"
pydantic-settings = ">=2.1.0"
python-multipart = ">=0.0.6"
structlog = ">=23.2.0"
pandas = ">=2.1.1"
python-dotenv = ">=1.0.0"
uuid = ">=1.30"
psutil = ">=7.0.0,<8.0.0"
# Reference to local biomapper package in development mode
biomapper = {path = "../", develop = true}  # ← This line was uncommented
pyyaml = "^6.0.2"
```

## Actions Taken

1. Investigated directory structure and found API in separate directory
2. Uncommented the biomapper dependency in biomapper-api's pyproject.toml
3. Updated poetry.lock and installed dependencies
4. Started API service successfully
5. Verified health endpoint
6. Executed end-to-end pipeline successfully

## Deployment Notes

- The fix requires running `poetry install` in the biomapper-api directory
- API must be started from the biomapper-api directory using `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app`
- The biomapper core library is linked as a development dependency
