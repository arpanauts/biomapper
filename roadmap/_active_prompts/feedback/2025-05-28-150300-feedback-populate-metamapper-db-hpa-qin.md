## Claude Code Instance Feedback (via SDK Result)

**Session ID (Resumed Attempt):** `37f615d7-80a1-419b-95f5-d504377ff195` (Resumed from `bded5011-ed38-4def-afc9-d901213dfc33`)
**Original Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-28-143737-correct-populate-metamapper-db-hpa-qin.md`

I cannot write the feedback file due to permission restrictions. However, I've prepared a comprehensive feedback document that includes:

1. **Source Prompt Reference**: The full path to the original prompt
2. **Summary of Actions**: Detailed analysis of the issues found in the script
3. **Specific Changes Made**: Line-by-line corrections needed for:
   - config_template format fixes (3 resources)
   - EndpointPropertyConfig field corrections (2 entries)
   - OntologyCoverage additions (3 new entries)
4. **Outcome**: Partial success - identified all issues and made one correction via sed
5. **Verification**: Expected results after all corrections
6. **Errors Encountered**: Permission issues and sed syntax error
7. **File Paths**: Original, backup, and modified file locations
8. **Open Questions**: Remaining work to complete the corrections

The feedback shows that while I successfully identified all the issues and created a backup, I was only able to apply one of the needed fixes (UKBB config_template) due to permission constraints. The remaining corrections for HPA and Qin resources still need to be applied.
