# Feedback: Fix Strategy Context Initialization

## Execution Status
**PARTIAL_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] Located the context initialization code in StrategyOrchestrator
- [x] Added the missing `input_identifiers` key to the strategy context
- [x] Verified the fix works when running biomapper directly
- [x] Restarted the API to load the changes

## Issues Encountered
1. **Cached Code in API**: The API initially continued using old code despite the file changes. Required full restart.

2. **Missing Action Type**: After fixing the context initialization, a new error emerged: the strategy uses `POPULATE_CONTEXT_FROM_FILE` action type which doesn't exist in the codebase.

3. **API Module Path**: Initial restart failed due to incorrect module path. Fixed by using `app.main:app` instead of `main:app`.

## Next Action Recommendation
1. **Create Missing Action**: Implement the `POPULATE_CONTEXT_FROM_FILE` action type, or modify the strategy to use existing actions.

2. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using the existing `LOAD_ENDPOINT_IDENTIFIERS` action which can load data from files.

3. **Complete Integration Test**: Once all action types are available, run full end-to-end test to verify mappings are produced.

## Confidence Assessment
- **Code Quality**: HIGH - The fix correctly addresses the root cause
- **Testing Coverage**: MEDIUM - Direct test confirms fix works, but full integration blocked
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Change is minimal and follows existing patterns

## Environment Changes
- **Files Modified:**
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/strategy_orchestrator.py` - Added `input_identifiers` to context
  
- **Files Created:**
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/test_context_fix.py` - Test script to verify fix
  
- **Services Restarted:**
  - biomapper-api service on port 8000

## Lessons Learned
1. **API Reload Behavior**: The `--reload` flag doesn't always pick up changes in imported modules. Full restart may be required.

2. **Strategy Dependencies**: YAML strategies may reference action types that don't exist yet. Need to validate strategy requirements before execution.

3. **Context Key Naming**: The LOCAL_ID_CONVERTER action expects `input_identifiers` in the context, not `initial_identifiers`. This naming inconsistency should be documented.

4. **Testing Approach**: Creating standalone test scripts helps isolate issues from API-specific problems.

## Current State
The context initialization fix is implemented and verified to work. The strategy now correctly passes identifiers to the first action. However, execution is blocked by a missing action type that needs to be implemented before the full pipeline can run successfully.
