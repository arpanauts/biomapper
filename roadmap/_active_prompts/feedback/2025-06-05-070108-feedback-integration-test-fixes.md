# Feedback: Integration Test Interface and Async Handling Fixes

**Date:** 2025-06-05  
**Time:** 07:01:08  
**Prompt:** `2025-06-05-060125-prompt-fix-integration-test-interface-async-errors.md`

## Summary

Addressed multiple integration test issues related to interface mismatches and async handling in `test_historical_id_mapping.py` and `test_yaml_strategy_ukbb_hpa.py`.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed: `test_historical_id_mapping.py` - Result Structure Mismatch

**Issue:** Test expected a result structure with `"status"` and `"results"` keys, but `execute_mapping` returns just the results dictionary directly.

**Fix:** Updated test assertions to match the actual return format:
```python
# Before:
assert "status" in mapping_result
assert "results" in mapping_result
results = mapping_result["results"]

# After:
results = await executor.execute_mapping(...)
assert isinstance(results, dict)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - All three test methods updated

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed: `test_yaml_strategy_ukbb_hpa.py` - Async Fixture Handling

**Issue:** `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'async_metamapper_session'`

**Root Cause:** pytest-asyncio in STRICT mode wasn't properly handling async fixtures with yield

**Fix:** 
1. Added `pytest_asyncio` import
2. Changed fixture decorators from `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture`
3. Removed non-existent `initialize()` and `close()` method calls
4. Created tables directly using SQLAlchemy metadata

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Fixtures now work correctly with pytest-asyncio

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed: MappingExecutor Database Session Issues

**Issue:** `'MappingExecutor' object has no attribute 'db_session'` and `'sessionmaker' object has no attribute 'execute'`

**Root Cause:** Strategy action classes expected an AsyncSession instance but were being passed a sessionmaker

**Fix:** Modified `_execute_strategy_action` to:
1. Create a session using the sessionmaker
2. Pass the actual session to action classes
3. Update context with the session

```python
async with self.async_metamapper_session() as session:
    context["db_session"] = session
    action = ConvertIdentifiersLocalAction(session)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Actions now receive proper session instances

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. ‚ùå Not Found: `setup_mock_endpoints` TypeError

**Expected Issue:** `TypeError: setup_mock_endpoints.<locals>.configure() missing 1 required positional argument: 'target_property'`

**Finding:** This issue was not present in the test file. The `setup_mock_endpoints` fixture in `conftest.py` already accepts all required parameters including `target_property`.

### 2. ‚ùå Not Verified: `get_db_manager` TypeError  

**Expected Issue:** `TypeError: get_db_manager() got an unexpected keyword argument 'metamapper_db_url'`

**Finding:** The `get_db_manager` function signature is correct and doesn't accept `metamapper_db_url`. This error wasn't encountered in the files we tested, suggesting it may be in a different test file or already fixed.

### 3. ‚ùå Not Found: `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'populated_db' was never awaited`

**Finding:** After fixing the pytest-asyncio fixture decorators, this warning should be resolved. The fixtures are now properly handled by pytest-asyncio.

## Testing Status

### Verified Working:
- ‚úÖ `test_historical_id_mapping.py::TestHistoricalIDMapping::test_mapping_with_historical_resolution`
- ‚úÖ `test_yaml_strategy_ukbb_hpa.py::TestUKBBToHPAYAMLStrategy::test_strategy_loaded_in_database`

### Partially Tested:
- üîÑ `test_yaml_strategy_ukbb_hpa.py::TestUKBBToHPAYAMLStrategy::test_execute_yaml_strategy_basic` - Fixed session issues, but may have other errors

### Not Yet Tested:
- Other tests in both files need full test runs to verify all issues are resolved

## Recommendations

1. **Run Full Test Suite:** Execute all integration tests to identify any remaining issues:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -xvs
   ```

2. **Check for Additional Files:** The `get_db_manager` TypeError might be in other test files mentioned in the grep results:
   - `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`
   - Other files using `get_db_manager` with incorrect parameters

3. **Poetry Requirement:** Confirmed that Poetry is necessary for these tests due to:
   - No `requirements.txt` file exists
   - Complex dependency management including git-based dependencies
   - Test-specific dependencies in dev group

## Conclusion

Successfully addressed the main integration test issues related to:
- Result structure expectations
- Async fixture handling with pytest-asyncio
- Database session management for strategy actions

The fixes enable the integration tests to properly execute with correct interfaces and async handling. Some expected issues were not found, suggesting they may have been resolved elsewhere or exist in different test files not examined in this session.
