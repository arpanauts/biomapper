# Feedback: Enhance MetadataQueryService

**Task Reference:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-22-171745-prompt-enhance-metadata-query-service.md`
**Completion Date:** 2025-06-22-174726
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully enhanced the `MetadataQueryService` by moving the remaining metadata and database query methods from `MappingExecutor` into it. This centralizes all direct database query logic for metadata in one service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added `MappingStrategy` to the imports in `metadata_query_service.py:20`

### 2. Added Methods to MetadataQueryService

#### `get_endpoint_by_name` (lines 160-171)
- Moved from `MappingExecutor._get_endpoint_by_name`
- Made public by removing the underscore prefix
- Delegates to the existing `get_endpoint` method for consistency
- Maintains the same functionality and interface

#### `get_strategy` (lines 173-190)
- Moved from `MappingExecutor.get_strategy`
- No changes to the method implementation
- Accepts a session parameter consistent with other service methods
- Returns `Optional[MappingStrategy]`

### 3. File Changes
- **Modified:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/services/metadata_query_service.py`
  - Added import for `MappingStrategy`
  - Added `get_endpoint_by_name` method
  - Added `get_strategy` method

## Success Criteria Verification

✅ **The `MetadataQueryService` class now contains the `get_endpoint_by_name` and `get_strategy` methods.**
- Both methods have been successfully added to the service

✅ **The logic is identical to the original methods, adapted for the service's own dependencies.**
- `get_endpoint_by_name` delegates to the existing `get_endpoint` method
- `get_strategy` maintains the exact same implementation, using the session parameter
- Both methods accept `AsyncSession` as their first parameter after `self`

## Technical Notes

1. **Session Management**: The service already has proper session management through the `SessionManager` provided during initialization. The new methods follow the same pattern as existing methods by accepting a session parameter.

2. **Method Naming**: The `_get_endpoint_by_name` was renamed to `get_endpoint_by_name` (removing underscore) to make it a public method of the service.

3. **Error Handling**: Both methods maintain their original error handling:
   - `get_endpoint_by_name` relies on the error handling in `get_endpoint`
   - `get_strategy` catches `SQLAlchemyError` and logs errors, returning `None` on failure

4. **Compatibility**: These methods can now be called from `MappingExecutor` through its `metadata_query_service` instance, maintaining backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

1. Update `MappingExecutor` to use the service methods instead of its own implementations
2. Remove the original methods from `MappingExecutor` to avoid duplication
3. Update any other code that directly calls these methods on `MappingExecutor`

## Conclusion

The task has been completed successfully. The `MetadataQueryService` now serves as the centralized location for all metadata-related database queries, improving the separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable.
