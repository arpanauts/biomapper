# Feedback: Enhance MetadataQueryService

**Task:** Enhance MetadataQueryService
**Date:** 2025-06-22 18:27:04
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Successfully enhanced the `MetadataQueryService` by moving the remaining metadata and database query methods from `MappingExecutor` into it.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated imports in MetadataQueryService**:
   - Added `MappingStrategy` to the imports from `...db.models`

2. **Added `get_endpoint_by_name` method**:
   - This is a public wrapper around the existing `get_endpoint` method
   - Maintains the same signature as the original `_get_endpoint_by_name` in MappingExecutor
   - Simply delegates to the existing `get_endpoint` method

3. **Added `get_strategy` method**:
   - Moved the complete implementation from MappingExecutor
   - Uses the SessionManager to create database sessions
   - Queries the MappingStrategy table by strategy name
   - Includes proper error handling and logging

## File Modified

- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/services/metadata_query_service.py`

## Success Criteria Met

✅ The `MetadataQueryService` class now contains the `get_endpoint_by_name` and `get_strategy` methods
✅ The logic is identical to the original methods, adapted for the service's own dependencies

## Notes

- The `_get_endpoint_by_name` method in MappingExecutor was already delegating to `metadata_query_service.get_endpoint`, so we only needed to add a public wrapper method in MetadataQueryService
- The `get_strategy` method was fully moved with its complete implementation
- Both methods maintain their original signatures and behavior
- The service now centralizes all direct database query logic for metadata as intended
