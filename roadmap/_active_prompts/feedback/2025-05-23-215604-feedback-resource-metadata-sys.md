# Feedback: Resource Metadata System Architecture Document

## Task Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive architecture document for the Resource Metadata System as requested in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-23-213400-prompt-create-resource-metadata-sys-plan.md`.

## Work Completed

1. **Created Architecture Document**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/resource_metadata_system.md`
   - The document is approximately 2,500 words and covers all requested areas
   - Organized into 11 major sections with detailed subsections

2. **Key Sections Delivered**:
   - **Types of Metadata**: Comprehensive taxonomy covering Resource-Level, Entity-Level, Mapping-Level, and Performance metadata
   - **Storage Strategy**: Detailed database schema extensions and new table designs
   - **Integration Points**: Specific code examples for MappingExecutor and new MetadataManager component
   - **RAG-Specific Metadata**: Dedicated section for PubChemRAGMappingClient integration
   - **User-Facing Features**: API endpoints, reporting capabilities, and transparency features
   - **Implementation Roadmap**: 5-phase, 10-week implementation plan
   - **Scalability and Security**: Considerations for production deployment

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Database Approach**: 
   - Extended `mapping_cache.db` for mapping-specific metadata
   - New tables in `metamapper.db` for resource and entity metadata
   - This maintains separation of concerns while enabling rich metadata capture

2. **MetadataManager Component**:
   - Centralized component for all metadata operations
   - Handles both immediate storage and deferred enrichment
   - Provides abstraction layer between mapping logic and storage

3. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Start with foundation and basic capture
   - Progressively add RAG integration, API enhancements, and advanced features
   - Allows for iterative development and early value delivery

## Assumptions Made

1. **Performance Requirements**: Assumed that metadata operations should not significantly impact mapping performance, leading to the deferred enrichment pattern
2. **Storage Capacity**: Assumed JSON column support in SQLite for flexible metadata storage
3. **API Backwards Compatibility**: Designed enriched API models to extend existing ones rather than replace them

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Metadata Volume**: Proposed TTL policies and archival strategies to manage growth
2. **Performance Impact**: Suggested caching layers and batch operations to minimize overhead
3. **Flexibility vs. Structure**: Balanced structured fields with JSON storage for extensibility

## Alignment with Project Context

The architecture aligns well with:
- Current `MappingExecutor` patterns (discovered through code analysis)
- Existing database schema in `EntityMapping` model
- Planned enhancements from the RAG feature design documents
- Open questions from the latest status update about metadata extraction and evaluation

## Next Steps Recommendation

Based on this architecture, the next logical steps would be:
1. Review and refine the architecture with the team
2. Create a detailed implementation plan for Phase 1
3. Begin prototyping the MetadataManager component
4. Design specific database migrations for schema changes

## Document Location

The completed architecture document is available at:
