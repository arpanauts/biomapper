# Feedback: Decompose Bidirectional Validation from `execute_mapping`

## Completed Subtasks

### 1. Created BidirectionalValidationService
- Created new file: `biomapper/core/services/bidirectional_validation_service.py`
- This service encapsulates all bidirectional validation logic that was previously embedded in the `MappingExecutor.execute_mapping` method
- The service includes:
  - `validate_mappings()`: Main entry point that orchestrates the validation process
  - `_extract_target_ids()`: Helper to extract target IDs from successful mappings
  - `_reconcile_bidirectional_mappings()`: Core logic to enrich mappings with validation status
  - `_build_target_to_sources_mapping()`: Helper to build reverse mapping lookups
  - `_normalize_arivale_id()`: Utility for handling Arivale ID prefixes

### 2. Updated MappingExecutor
- Modified `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`:
  - Added import for `BidirectionalValidationService`
  - Instantiated the service in `__init__` method
  - Replaced the entire bidirectional validation block (lines 1100-1116) with a single call to the service
  - Removed the `_reconcile_bidirectional_mappings` method (lines 1303-1389) as it's now in the service

### 3. Created Comprehensive Unit Tests
- Created `tests/unit/core/services/test_bidirectional_validation_service.py`
- Tests cover all aspects of the service:
  - Validation with no mappings
  - Validation with no reverse path
  - Validation with successful reverse mappings
  - Target ID extraction
  - Arivale ID normalization
  - Various reconciliation scenarios (validated, ambiguous, no reverse path)
- All 8 tests pass successfully

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Circular Dependencies
- Initial concern about circular dependencies was avoided by using `Any` type annotation for the `mapping_executor` parameter
- The service accepts the executor as a parameter rather than importing it, maintaining clean dependency flow

### 2. Type Annotations
- Had to add proper type annotations to satisfy mypy type checking
- Used `Any` type for parameters that would create circular imports

### 3. Linting Issues
- Fixed unused import (`List` from typing)
- Handled edge case in `_normalize_arivale_id` where prefix exists but no content follows

## Next Action Recommendation

The bidirectional validation logic has been successfully extracted into a dedicated service. The refactoring is complete and tested. Consider these potential next steps:

1. **Integration Testing**: Add integration tests that verify the bidirectional validation works end-to-end with real database connections
2. **Performance Optimization**: Consider adding caching for reverse path lookups if the same paths are used frequently
3. **Enhanced Validation**: The service could be extended to support different validation strategies (strict, fuzzy, etc.)

## Confidence Assessment

**High confidence** - The refactoring was straightforward and successful:
- Clean separation of concerns achieved
- No circular dependencies introduced
- All existing functionality preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage added
- Code is more maintainable and testable
- The service interface is clear and well-documented

The modularization improves code organization and makes the bidirectional validation logic easier to understand, test, and potentially reuse in other contexts.
