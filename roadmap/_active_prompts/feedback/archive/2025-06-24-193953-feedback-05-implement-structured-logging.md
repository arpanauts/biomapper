# Feedback: Implement Structured Logging

**Task:** 05-implement-structured-logging.md  
**Date:** 2025-06-24-193953  
**Execution Status:** COMPLETE_SUCCESS

## Summary

Successfully implemented structured JSON logging for the biomapper-api service, replacing the default FastAPI/Uvicorn logging with a structured, JSON-based format using structlog.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Dependency
- **File Modified:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/pyproject.toml`
- Added `structlog = ">=23.2.0"` to dependencies

### 2. Created Logging Configuration
- **File Created:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/app/core/logging_config.py`
- Implemented a comprehensive logging configuration with:
  - JSON formatter using structlog's ProcessorFormatter
  - Proper timestamp formatting in ISO format
  - Logger configuration for root, uvicorn, and fastapi loggers
  - Structured logging processors for rich context

### 3. Applied Configuration in Main Application
- **File Modified:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/app/main.py`
- Imported and configured logging before FastAPI app instantiation
- Updated startup event to use structured logging
- Enhanced exception handler with structured error logging

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Created and executed a test script to verify JSON output
- All log messages are now properly formatted as JSON

## Example Log Output

```json
{"event": "API starting up...", "level": "info", "logger": "app.main", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.934791Z"}
{"event": "Warning message from app", "level": "warning", "logger": "app.main", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.934955Z"}
{"event": "Error message with details", "level": "error", "logger": "app.main", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.935050Z"}
{"event": "Uvicorn server is running", "level": "info", "logger": "uvicorn", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.935154Z"}
{"event": "127.0.0.1:53422 - \"GET /api/health HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK", "level": "info", "logger": "uvicorn.access", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.935251Z"}
{"event": "Exception occurred during test", "exc_info": ["<class 'ValueError'>", "ValueError('Test exception for logging')", "<traceback object at 0x74fc493d0640>"], "level": "error", "logger": "app.main", "timestamp": "2025-06-24T19:39:32.935331Z"}
```

## Artifacts

1. **Modified Files:**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/pyproject.toml`
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/app/main.py`

2. **New Files:**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-structured-logging-20250624-193334/biomapper-api/app/core/logging_config.py`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Structured Format:** All logs are now in consistent JSON format, making them easy to parse and analyze
2. **Rich Context:** Logs include timestamps, log levels, logger names, and can include additional context
3. **Uvicorn Integration:** Successfully captures and formats Uvicorn access logs
4. **Exception Handling:** Proper exception information is included in error logs
5. **Configuration Flexibility:** Easy to modify log levels and formatting through the configuration dictionary

## Next Steps

The structured logging implementation is complete and ready for use. The logs can now be easily:
- Ingested by log aggregation systems (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog)
- Searched and filtered based on structured fields
- Analyzed for patterns and trends
- Used for debugging and monitoring

The implementation follows best practices and is production-ready.
