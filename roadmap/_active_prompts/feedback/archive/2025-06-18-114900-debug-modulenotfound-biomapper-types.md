# Prompt: Debug ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper.types

**Task Objective:**
Resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.types'` that occurs when executing the main mapping pipeline. The root cause is an incorrect import path for the `PathExecutionStatus` class in `path_execution_manager.py` due to recent refactoring.

**Prerequisites:**
- The file `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` must exist and be writable.

**Input Context:**
1.  **File to Modify:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py`
2.  **Error Traceback:**
    ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py", line 52, in <module>
        from biomapper.core import MappingExecutor
      ...
      File "/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py", line 20, in <module>
        from biomapper.types import PathExecutionStatus
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.types'
    ```
3.  **Investigation Finding:** A search has confirmed that the `PathExecutionStatus` class is now defined in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/db/cache_models.py`.

**Expected Outputs:**
- The file `path_execution_manager.py` will be modified to correct the import statement.
- A confirmation message stating that the file was successfully updated.

**Success Criteria:**
- After the change, executing `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` from the project root (`/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`) no longer raises the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `biomapper.types` and proceeds to the next execution step or a different error.

**Error Recovery Instructions:**
- If you do not have permission to write to the file, report a file permission error.
- If the new import path `from biomapper.db.cache_models import PathExecutionStatus` causes a different `ImportError`, report the new traceback immediately.

**Environment Requirements:**
- Access to the local filesystem to read and write files.
- A bash shell to execute commands.

**Task Decomposition:**
1.  Read the content of `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py`.
2.  Locate the incorrect import line: `from biomapper.types import PathExecutionStatus`.
3.  Replace it with the correct import line: `from biomapper.db.cache_models import PathExecutionStatus`.
4.  Save the changes to the file.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
1.  After saving, read the file again to confirm the change is present.
2.  Execute the command `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` from the `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/` directory and verify that the `ModuleNotFoundError` is resolved.

**Source Prompt Reference:**
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-114900-debug-modulenotfound-biomapper-types.md`

**Context from Previous Attempts:**
- An initial attempt to fix this involved directly modifying the file. However, per the user's request and project protocol, this action is being re-initiated through a formal prompt for a delegated agent.
- Investigation has already confirmed the `types.py` file is gone and the `PathExecutionStatus` class now resides in `db/cache_models.py`.
