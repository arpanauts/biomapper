# Feedback: Correct metamapper_session AttributeUsage in MappingExecutor

**Source Prompt Reference:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-05-021846-claude-prompt-fix-metamapper-session-attr.md`

**Execution Status:** COMPLETE_SUCCESS

## Completed Tasks
- [X] Identified all incorrect usages of `self.metamapper_session()` and `self.get_metamapper_session()` in MappingExecutor
- [X] Replaced all incorrect instances with the correct `self.async_metamapper_session()` 
- [X] Verified the corrections are contextually appropriate and syntactically valid

## Implementation Details

### Issues Found
A comprehensive scan of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` revealed **3 incorrect usages**:

1. **Line 329**: `self.get_metamapper_session()` - incorrect method name
2. **Line 2715**: `self.metamapper_session()` - incorrect attribute name  
3. **Line 3398**: `self.metamapper_session()` - incorrect attribute name (duplicate in code)

### Corrections Made

All three instances were corrected to use `self.async_metamapper_session()`:

**Before:**
```python
# Line 329
async with self.get_metamapper_session() as session:

# Lines 2715 and 3398
async with self.metamapper_session() as session:
```

**After:**
```python
# All corrected to:
async with self.async_metamapper_session() as session:
```

### Context Verification

Each correction was verified to be within an async context where a database session was needed:

1. **Line 329** - Within `_get_path_details()` method for querying MappingPath
2. **Line 2715** - Within `execute_yaml_strategy()` method for loading strategy from database
3. **Line 3398** - Duplicate `execute_yaml_strategy()` method (appears to be duplicated code)

## Validation Results

### Post-Fix Verification
```bash
grep -n "metamapper.*session" /home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py
```

Results show all usages are now correct:
- Line 216: `self.async_metamapper_session = self.MetamapperSessionFactory` (definition)
- Lines 329, 1366, 1648, 2715, 3398: All using `self.async_metamapper_session()`

### Syntax Validation
- Python syntax check passed successfully
- No new errors introduced

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The AttributeError occurred because:
1. The `__init__` method defines: `self.async_metamapper_session = self.MetamapperSessionFactory`
2. Code was attempting to use non-existent attributes/methods:
   - `self.metamapper_session()` (missing 'async_' prefix)
   - `self.get_metamapper_session()` (method doesn't exist)

### Impact
- **Before fix**: Code would fail with `AttributeError` when trying to obtain database sessions
- **After fix**: Code correctly obtains AsyncSession instances from the factory

## Issues Encountered
1. **Code duplication**: The file appears to have duplicate method definitions (e.g., `execute_yaml_strategy` appears twice), which required fixing the same error in multiple locations.

2. **Inconsistent naming**: One instance used `get_metamapper_session()` while others used `metamapper_session()`, suggesting possible refactoring attempts that were incomplete.

## Next Action Recommendation
**COMPLETE** - All incorrect session attribute usages have been fixed. The code should now execute without AttributeError when accessing the metamapper database session.

### Optional Follow-up
Consider addressing the apparent code duplication in the file, as there seem to be duplicate method definitions that could lead to confusion and maintenance issues.

## Confidence Assessment
- **Quality of implementation:** High - Simple attribute name corrections with clear before/after states
- **Testing coverage:** Medium - Syntax validated but runtime testing recommended
- **Potential risks:** Low - Changes are straightforward attribute name fixes

## Environment Changes
### Modified Files:
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` - 3 lines modified to correct session attribute usage

### Breaking Changes:
- None - This fix resolves errors rather than changing any public APIs

## Lessons Learned
1. **Consistent naming matters**: The session factory is named with the `async_` prefix, and all usages must match this naming convention.

2. **Code duplication detection**: The presence of duplicate method definitions suggests the codebase may benefit from a deduplication pass.

3. **Attribute access patterns**: When working with async SQLAlchemy sessions, ensure the factory attribute name is used consistently throughout the codebase.

## Code Quality Notes
- The fix maintains the existing async/await patterns
- No changes to logic or flow, only attribute name corrections
- All corrections follow the established pattern used elsewhere in the file (lines 1366, 1648)
