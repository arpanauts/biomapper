# Feedback: Refactor `_execute_mapping_step` into a Dedicated Service

**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Task:** Refactor `_execute_mapping_step` into a Dedicated Service

## Completed Subtasks

1. **Created MappingStepExecutionService** 
   - Created new service file at `biomapper/core/services/mapping_step_execution_service.py`
   - Extracted all logic from `MappingExecutor._execute_mapping_step` method
   - Service handles forward mapping, reverse mapping, client interaction, and error handling
   - Properly handles UniProt cache bypass when environment variable is set

2. **Updated MappingExecutor to use the new service**
   - Imported and initialized MappingStepExecutionService in MappingExecutor
   - Replaced the `_execute_mapping_step` method with a simple delegation to the service
   - Passed the service to MappingPathExecutionService for dependency injection

3. **Updated MappingPathExecutionService**
   - Added optional `step_execution_service` parameter to constructor
   - Modified step execution to use the service when available, fallback to executor otherwise
   - This provides flexibility and maintains backward compatibility

4. **Created comprehensive test suite**
   - Created `tests/core/services/test_mapping_step_execution_service.py` with 8 tests
   - All tests passing, covering forward/reverse mapping, error handling, and edge cases
   - Fixed one test in the original test suite to accommodate the new `config=None` parameter

## Issues Encountered

1. **Missing BaseService class**: Initially tried to inherit from a BaseService that didn't exist. Resolved by directly implementing the service without inheritance.

2. **Import path confusion**: Had to determine correct import path for MappingPathStep (from `biomapper.db.models` not `biomapper.core.models`).

3. **Test failures**: One existing test expected `map_identifiers` to be called without the `config` parameter. Fixed by updating the test expectation.

4. **ClientError constructor**: Had to adjust error handling to match the actual ClientExecutionError constructor signature (error_code is set internally, not passed as parameter).

## Next Action Recommendation

The refactoring is complete and all tests are passing. The new service successfully isolates the step execution logic, improving cohesion and making the code more maintainable. The service is now injectable into other components that might need to execute individual mapping steps.

Consider the following for future improvements:
- Add metrics/monitoring to the step execution service
- Consider caching at the step level within the service
- Add more detailed logging for debugging complex mapping paths

## Confidence Assessment

**High confidence**. The refactoring was straightforward and well-defined. All tests are passing, and the new structure follows good software engineering principles with proper separation of concerns.
