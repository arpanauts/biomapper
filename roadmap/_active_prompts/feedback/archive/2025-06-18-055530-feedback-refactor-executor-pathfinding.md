# Feedback: Refactor MappingExecutor - Extract Path Finding Logic

**Date**: 2025-06-18  
**Task**: Extract path discovery and caching logic from MappingExecutor  
**Status**: Completed  

## Summary of Changes

Successfully extracted all path finding and caching logic from `mapping_executor.py` into dedicated modules, reducing the file by approximately 400 lines and improving maintainability through proper separation of concerns.

## Design of New Module(s)

### 1. **ReversiblePath Module** (`reversible_path.py`)
- **Purpose**: Wraps MappingPath objects to enable bidirectional execution
- **Key Features**:
  - Transparent delegation to original path attributes
  - Automatic priority adjustment for reverse paths (+5 to priority)
  - Step reversal for backward execution
  - Clear naming with "(Reverse)" suffix for reverse paths

### 2. **PathFinder Service** (`path_finder.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized service for discovering and caching mapping paths
- **Key Components**:
  - **Path Discovery**: Complex SQL queries for finding paths between ontologies
  - **Bidirectional Support**: Concurrent search in both forward and reverse directions
  - **Relationship-Specific Paths**: Priority support for endpoint-specific mappings
  - **LRU Cache**: Time-based expiration with configurable size limits
  - **Thread-Safe Operations**: Async locks for cache access

## Implementation Details

### PathFinder Class Architecture
```python
class PathFinder:
    def __init__(self, cache_size: int = 100, cache_expiry_seconds: int = 300)
    
    # Public API
    async def find_mapping_paths(...) -> List[Union[MappingPath, ReversiblePath]]
    async def find_best_path(...) -> Optional[Union[MappingPath, ReversiblePath]]
    
    # Internal methods
    async def _find_paths_for_relationship(...) -> List[MappingPath]
    async def _find_direct_paths(...) -> List[MappingPath]
    async def _get_cached_paths(...) -> Optional[List[...]
    async def _cache_paths(...) -> None
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Path finding logic isolated from execution logic
   - Cache management encapsulated within PathFinder
   - ReversiblePath handling separated into its own class

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - LRU cache prevents redundant database queries
   - Concurrent bidirectional path searches
   - Efficient cache eviction strategy

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Clear module boundaries
   - Focused responsibilities
   - Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions

4. **Testability**:
   - All components are independently testable
   - Mock-friendly design
   - Clear interfaces between modules

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive unit tests for both new modules:

### `test_reversible_path.py` (15 tests)
- Path wrapping and delegation
- Priority adjustments for reverse paths
- Step ordering for bidirectional execution
- Edge case handling (None values, missing attributes)

### `test_path_finder.py` (17 tests)
- Simple and bidirectional path finding
- Relationship-specific path discovery
- Cache functionality and expiration
- LRU eviction behavior
- Error handling and database exceptions
- Preferred direction ordering

## Integration Changes

Updated `mapping_executor.py` to delegate all path finding operations:
```python
# Before: 400+ lines of path finding code
# After: Simple delegation
async def _find_mapping_paths(self, ...):
    return await self.path_finder.find_mapping_paths(...)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Complexity**: `mapping_executor.py` is now more focused on execution
2. **Improved Reusability**: PathFinder can be used by other components
3. **Better Testing**: Isolated modules are easier to test thoroughly
4. **Performance**: Built-in caching reduces database load
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes future changes easier

## Next Steps

- Consider adding metrics/logging for cache hit rates
- Potentially expose cache configuration through settings
- Could add path validation logic to PathFinder
- Consider adding path filtering capabilities based on resource availability

## Files Modified

1. **Created**:
   - `/biomapper/core/reversible_path.py` (66 lines)
   - `/biomapper/core/path_finder.py` (533 lines)
   - `/tests/unit/core/test_reversible_path.py` (136 lines)
   - `/tests/unit/core/test_path_finder.py` (405 lines)

2. **Modified**:
   - `/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` (removed ~400 lines, added imports and delegation)

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully achieved the goal of extracting path finding logic into well-designed, focused modules. The code is now more maintainable, testable, and performant while maintaining full backward compatibility.
