# Detailed Feedback Report: MappingExecutor Path Priority Fix

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-05-29 18:15:00 UTC
- **Task**: Fix MappingExecutor Path Selection Logic
- **Source Prompt**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-29-174029-fix-mapping-executor-path-priority.md`
- **Implementer**: Claude Code Instance
- **Status**: Implementation Complete - Awaiting Testing

## Executive Summary

The MappingExecutor's path selection logic has been successfully enhanced to properly prioritize relationship-specific mapping paths. The implementation adds support for the `RelationshipMappingPath` table, ensuring that paths defined for specific endpoint relationships (such as UKBB_Protein → HPA_Protein) are selected based on their priority values, resolving the issue where generic identity paths were being incorrectly chosen over specialized paths like `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName`.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The original `MappingExecutor` implementation had a fundamental limitation in its path selection algorithm:

1. **Ontology-Only Matching**: The `_find_direct_paths` method selected paths based solely on matching source and target ontology types
2. **No Relationship Context**: It ignored the `EndpointRelationship` and `RelationshipMappingPath` tables entirely
3. **Global Path Pool**: All paths with matching ontologies were considered, regardless of their intended endpoint relationships

### Specific Issue Case
For UKBB → HPA protein mapping:
- **Desired Path**: `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` (priority=1, maps UNIPROTKB_AC → GENE_NAME)
- **Actually Selected**: Generic identity path (UNIPROTKB_AC → UNIPROTKB_AC)
- **Result**: Mapping failures due to incompatible identity mapping between different datasets

## Implementation Details

### 1. Code Modifications

#### A. New Imports Added
```python
from ..db.models import (
    # ... existing imports ...
    EndpointRelationship,
    RelationshipMappingPath,
)
```

#### B. New Method: `_find_paths_for_relationship`
Location: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` (lines 573-674)

**Purpose**: Query paths specifically associated with an endpoint relationship

**Key Features**:
- Finds the `EndpointRelationship` between source and target endpoints
- Joins `MappingPath` with `RelationshipMappingPath` based on relationship
- Filters by matching source/target ontologies
- Orders by priority (ascending - lower numbers = higher priority)
- Returns only active paths with eager-loaded steps

**Query Logic**:
```sql
-- Conceptual SQL representation
SELECT mapping_paths.*
FROM mapping_paths
JOIN relationship_mapping_paths ON 
    relationship_mapping_paths.ontology_path_id = mapping_paths.id
WHERE 
    relationship_mapping_paths.relationship_id = ? AND
    relationship_mapping_paths.source_ontology = ? AND
    relationship_mapping_paths.target_ontology = ? AND
    mapping_paths.is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY mapping_paths.priority ASC
```

#### C. Enhanced `_find_mapping_paths` Method
**Changes**:
- Added optional `source_endpoint` and `target_endpoint` parameters
- Implemented two-tier path selection:
  1. **First Priority**: Relationship-specific paths (if endpoints provided)
  2. **Fallback**: General ontology-based paths

**Logic Flow**:
```
IF endpoints provided:
    paths = query relationship-specific paths
    IF paths found:
        USE relationship paths (respect priority)
    ELSE:
        LOG "No relationship paths found"
        USE general path search
ELSE:
    USE general path search
```

#### D. Updated `_find_best_path` Method
- Added endpoint parameters to signature
- Passes endpoints through to `_find_mapping_paths`

#### E. Modified Method Calls
1. **Primary Mapping** (line 1688-1696):
   - Passes `source_endpoint` and `target_endpoint` to path finder

2. **Bidirectional Validation** (line 1973-1981):
   - Passes swapped endpoints for reverse validation

### 2. Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

- **Optional Parameters**: All endpoint parameters are optional
- **Graceful Fallback**: If no relationship paths exist, uses original logic
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code without endpoint context continues to work

### 3. Performance Considerations

**Added Overhead**:
- One additional query when endpoints are provided
- Query is well-optimized with proper joins and indexes

**Mitigations**:
- Existing path caching mechanism still applies
- Relationship query only executes when endpoints are available
- Falls back quickly if no relationship exists

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Immediate Verification Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Reset database with latest schema
python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py --drop-all

# Step 2: Test UKBB to HPA mapping
python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py

# Step 3: Monitor logs for confirmation
# Expected log messages:
# - "Checking for relationship-specific paths between endpoints X and Y"
# - "Found N relationship-specific mapping path(s) for relationship Z"
# - "Using N relationship-specific path(s)"
# - " - Path ID: XX, Name: 'UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName', Priority: 1"
```

### 2. Validation Criteria

**Success Indicators**:
- Log shows selection of `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` path
- No identity path (UNIPROTKB_AC → UNIPROTKB_AC) selection for HPA
- Output file contains gene name mappings, not UniProt ACs
- QIN mapping continues to work (regression test)

**Failure Indicators**:
- Identity path still being selected
- Empty or incorrect output files
- Errors related to missing relationships or paths

### 3. Full Dataset Testing

If initial tests pass:
```bash
# Modify scripts to use full dataset
# Update INPUT_FILE to: /home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv
# Ensure INPUT_COLUMN_NAME = "UniProt"

# Run full mappings
python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py
python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_qin.py
```

## Risks and Mitigations

### Identified Risks

1. **Missing Relationship Data**
   - **Risk**: `EndpointRelationship` entries might be missing
   - **Mitigation**: Falls back to general path search
   - **Verification**: Check logs for "No EndpointRelationship found" messages

2. **Incorrect Priority Values**
   - **Risk**: Paths might have wrong priority assignments
   - **Mitigation**: Fix requires database update only, no code changes

3. **Performance Impact**
   - **Risk**: Additional queries might slow down execution
   - **Mitigation**: Caching and optimized queries minimize impact

## Future Enhancements

1. **Explicit Relationship Mapping Method**
   - Add `execute_mapping_by_relationship()` method for direct relationship-based execution

2. **Priority Conflict Resolution**
   - Add logic to handle paths with identical priorities
   - Consider success rate and performance metrics

3. **Relationship Path Caching**
   - Implement specific cache for relationship-path lookups
   - Reduce repeated database queries

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the core issue by introducing relationship-aware path selection while maintaining system stability and backward compatibility. The fix is ready for testing, and the provided testing strategy should quickly validate its effectiveness.
