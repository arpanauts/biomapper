# Feedback: Enhanced MappingExecutor for YAML Strategy Execution

**Task Completed**: 2025-06-05 03:21:47 UTC  
**Original Prompt**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-05-024644-prompt-enhance-mapping-executor.md`

## Summary

Successfully enhanced the MappingExecutor class to support execution of YAML-defined mapping strategies stored in the metamapper database. The implementation includes strategy loading, step execution with action dispatching, comprehensive result tracking via MappingResultBundle, and robust error handling.

## What Was Done

### 1. Core Implementation
- **Added `execute_strategy` method** to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
  - Loads strategies and steps from the metamapper database
  - Implements step-by-step execution with state tracking
  - Includes action handler dispatch mechanism
  - Provides comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Result Tracking
- **Created `MappingResultBundle` class** 
  - Tracks execution state, identifiers, and ontology types throughout strategy execution
  - Records detailed step-by-step provenance
  - Provides execution metrics (timing, success/failure counts)
  - Includes serialization method for easy integration

### 3. Action Handlers (Placeholders)
- **Implemented three placeholder action handlers**:
  - `_handle_convert_identifiers_local`: For local identifier conversions
  - `_handle_execute_mapping_path`: For executing named mapping paths
  - `_handle_filter_identifiers_by_target_presence`: For filtering based on target presence
  - All handlers log execution details and return appropriate placeholder results

### 4. Exception Handling
- **Added custom exceptions** to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/exceptions.py`:
  - `StrategyNotFoundError` with error code `STRATEGY_NOT_FOUND_ERROR`
  - `InactiveStrategyError` with error code `INACTIVE_STRATEGY_ERROR`
  - Integrated with existing BiomapperError hierarchy

### 5. Testing
- **Created comprehensive test script** at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/test_execute_strategy.py`
  - Tests successful strategy execution
  - Verifies error handling for non-existent strategies
  - Tests with empty identifier lists
  - Validates MappingResultBundle output format

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Added new method alongside existing `execute_yaml_strategy` rather than replacing it
- **Rationale**: Maintains backward compatibility while providing the new interface specified in the prompt

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Treat all steps as required since `is_required` field doesn't exist on `MappingStrategyStep`
- **Rationale**: Conservative approach ensures failures are properly reported; can be relaxed when field is added

### 3. State Management
- **Decision**: Track both current identifiers and current ontology type through execution
- **Rationale**: Allows for proper identifier transformation tracking and ontology type changes between steps

### 4. Result Bundle Design
- **Decision**: Comprehensive tracking with both step results and provenance
- **Rationale**: Provides multiple views of execution data for different use cases (debugging, auditing, visualization)

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. File Insertion Challenge
- **Issue**: Multiple `execute_yaml_strategy` methods in the file made direct editing difficult
- **Solution**: Used file manipulation with bash commands to insert at the correct location

### 2. Missing Database Field
- **Issue**: `MappingStrategyStep` doesn't have `is_required` field referenced in prompt
- **Solution**: Modified implementation to treat all steps as required with appropriate TODO comments

### 3. Test Script Assumptions
- **Issue**: Initial test script assumed fields that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated test script to match actual database schema

## Verification Results

The implementation was successfully tested with the UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE strategy:
- ✅ Strategy loaded correctly from database
- ✅ All 4 steps executed in sequence
- ✅ Placeholder handlers called with correct parameters
- ✅ MappingResultBundle tracked execution state properly
- ✅ Error handling worked for non-existent strategies
- ✅ Empty identifier lists handled gracefully

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Real Action Handlers**: Replace placeholder implementations with actual logic:
   - Connect `_handle_convert_identifiers_local` to local conversion infrastructure
   - Link `_handle_execute_mapping_path` to existing path execution logic
   - Implement filtering logic in `_handle_filter_identifiers_by_target_presence`

2. **Add `is_required` Field**: Update database schema to include the `is_required` field on `MappingStrategyStep`

3. **Performance Optimization**: Consider adding:
   - Batch processing for large identifier sets
   - Progress callbacks for long-running strategies
   - Caching integration for repeated executions

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Integrate with existing metrics tracking for strategy execution visibility

## Code Quality Notes

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging added at all decision points
- **Documentation**: All methods have detailed docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for clarity
- **Error Messages**: Descriptive error messages with context
- **Code Organization**: Follows existing patterns in MappingExecutor

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` - Enhanced with new methods
2. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/exceptions.py` - Added custom exceptions
3. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/test_execute_strategy.py` - Created for testing
4. `/tmp/execute_strategy_method.py` - Temporary file (can be removed)

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets all requirements from the original prompt. The MappingExecutor can now load and execute YAML-defined strategies with comprehensive tracking and error handling. The placeholder action handlers provide clear integration points for the next phase of implementation.
