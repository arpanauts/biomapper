# Feedback: Successful Implementation of MappingPath Entity Type Migration

**Date:** 2025-06-05
**Time:** 07:35:38
**Task:** Implement Alembic Migration for `MappingPath` `entity_type` and Composite Unique Constraint
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Alembic migration to add the `entity_type` column to the `mapping_paths` table and create a composite unique constraint on `(name, entity_type)`. This migration resolves the widespread `UNIQUE constraint failed: mapping_paths.name, mapping_paths.entity_type` errors that were preventing integration tests from running.

## What Was Done

### 1. Migration File Implementation
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper_db_migrations/versions/05a1cef680a1_add_entity_type_to_mapping_paths_and_.py`
- **Approach:** Manual table recreation strategy for SQLite compatibility
- **Key Changes:**
  - Added `entity_type` column (String, NOT NULL)
  - Created composite unique constraint `uq_mapping_path_name_entity_type`
  - Set default value 'protein' for existing records

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

#### Upgrade Function:
```python
def upgrade():
    # Check if column already exists (defensive programming)
    conn = op.get_bind()
    inspector = sa.inspect(conn)
    columns = [col['name'] for col in inspector.get_columns('mapping_paths')]
    
    if 'entity_type' in columns:
        return
    
    # Create new table with updated schema
    op.create_table('mapping_paths_new', ...)
    
    # Copy data with default entity_type='protein'
    op.execute("""INSERT INTO mapping_paths_new ...""")
    
    # Drop old table and rename new
    op.drop_table('mapping_paths')
    op.rename_table('mapping_paths_new', 'mapping_paths')
```

#### Downgrade Function:
- Reverses the migration by recreating the table without `entity_type`
- Restores original unique constraint on just `name` column

### 3. Challenges Encountered and Solutions

1. **Alembic Batch Mode Issues:**
   - **Problem:** Circular dependency error when using `op.batch_alter_table`
   - **Solution:** Switched to manual table recreation approach

2. **Migration Location Confusion:**
   - **Problem:** Multiple alembic.ini files and migration directories
   - **Solution:** Identified correct location as `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper_db_migrations/`

3. **SQLite Limitations:**
   - **Problem:** Cannot add NOT NULL column without default in SQLite
   - **Solution:** Used table recreation with data migration

## Verification Results

### 1. Migration Applied Successfully
```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
# Output: Running upgrade 6d519cfd7460 -> 05a1cef680a1
```

### 2. Integration Test Results
- **Before Migration:** Tests failed with `UNIQUE constraint failed: mapping_paths.name, mapping_paths.entity_type`
- **After Migration:** Constraint error resolved; tests now fail with different error (`output_ontology_type is required`)
- **Conclusion:** Database schema issue successfully resolved

### 3. Test Command Used
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py::TestYAMLStrategyExecution::test_basic_linear_strategy -xvs
```

## Key Learnings

1. **SQLite Constraints:** Alembic's batch mode can encounter circular dependencies with complex schemas; manual table recreation is more reliable for SQLite
2. **Migration Testing:** Always test migrations on a clean database before applying to development/production
3. **Defensive Programming:** Check for existing schema changes before applying migrations to handle edge cases

## Next Steps

1. The database constraint issue is now resolved
2. Integration tests can proceed to address the new error: `output_ontology_type is required`
3. No additional database migrations are needed for the constraint issue

## Files Modified

1. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper_db_migrations/versions/05a1cef680a1_add_entity_type_to_mapping_paths_and_.py` - Created and implemented
2. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper.db` - Migration applied

## Deliverables Completed

✅ Fully populated Alembic migration script
✅ Clear explanation of Alembic operations and SQLite handling
✅ Confirmation that unique constraint errors are resolved in integration tests

## Additional Notes

- The migration uses a conservative approach with defensive checks
- Default `entity_type` value of 'protein' was chosen as a reasonable default for existing data
- The migration is reversible via the downgrade function if needed
