# Feedback: Uncomment Mapping Paths in protein_config.yaml

## Date: 2025-06-03 04:43:26 UTC

## Summary

Successfully uncommented mapping paths in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` as requested.

## 1. Specified Mapping Paths Uncommented

The following mapping paths were uncommented as explicitly requested:

- **ARIVALE_TO_UKBB_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 360-368)
- **UKBB_TO_ARIVALE_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 370-378)

Both paths were successfully uncommented with proper indentation preserved.

## 2. Additional Mapping Paths Uncommented

After reviewing the mapping_clients section, I identified several active clients and uncommented their associated mapping paths:

### ARIVALE_TO_HPP_VIA_GENE_NAME (lines 390-398)
- **Justification**: Both required clients are active:
  - `arivale_protein_to_uniprot_lookup` (active)
  - `hpp_uniprot_identity_lookup` (active at lines 212-220)

### SPOKE-related paths:
- **SPOKE_TO_ARIVALE_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 412-420)
- **SPOKE_TO_UKBB_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 422-430)
- **Justification**: The `spoke_node_to_uniprot_lookup` client is active (lines 291-299)

### KG2-related path:
- **KG2_TO_ARIVALE_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 433-441)
- **Justification**: The `kg2_entity_to_uniprot_lookup` client is active (lines 337-345)

### Function Health-related paths:
- **FUNCTION_HEALTH_TO_ARIVALE_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 444-452)
- **ARIVALE_TO_FUNCTION_HEALTH_VIA_UNIPROT** (lines 454-462)
- **Justification**: Both required clients are active:
  - `function_health_to_uniprot_lookup` (active at lines 245-253)
  - `uniprot_to_function_health_lookup` (active at lines 255-262)

## 3. Mapping Paths Left Commented

The following mapping path was left commented:

- **UKBB_TO_HPP_UNIPROT_IDENTITY** (lines 381-387)
- **Reason**: The required client `ukbb_uniprot_identity_lookup` is commented out (lines 162-170) in the mapping_clients section, so this path cannot function properly.

## Summary of Changes

- Total paths uncommented: 8
- Paths left commented: 1 (due to missing/commented client)
- All uncommented paths have their required clients active and properly configured
- The file now has a more complete set of protein mapping pathways enabled for testing
