# Feedback: Resolve Persistent "Strategy Not Found" Error by Unifying Database Path Configuration

## Summary

The database path discrepancy issue has been successfully resolved. The refactoring has unified all database path configurations to use a single source of truth.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Centralized Database Path Configuration
- Modified `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/config.py`
- Added `BIOMAPPER_ROOT` definition using `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]`
- Updated database URLs to use absolute paths:
  ```python
  metamapper_db_url: str = f"sqlite+aiosqlite:///{BIOMAPPER_ROOT / 'data' / 'metamapper.db'}"
  cache_db_url: str = f"sqlite+aiosqlite:///{BIOMAPPER_ROOT / 'data' / 'mapping_cache.db'}"
  ```

### 2. Updated Main Pipeline Script
- Modified `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
- Removed manual path construction code
- Now uses `settings.metamapper_db_url` directly

### 3. Updated Population Script
- Modified `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py`
- Ensured it uses `settings.metamapper_db_url` consistently
- Added support for both `type` and `action_class_path` formats in strategy definitions
- Enhanced validator to accept both action formats

### 4. Added Diagnostic Logging
- Added detailed logging to track strategy population
- Logs now show all strategies found in YAML files before insertion
- Logs confirm when strategies are being inserted into the database

## Validation Results

### Population Script Success
The population script now successfully loads all strategies including `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT`:
```
DIAGNOSTIC: Found 4 strategies for entity 'protein': UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE, UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_OPTIMIZED, HANDLE_COMPOSITE_UNIPROT, UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT
DIAGNOSTIC: Inserting strategy 'UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT' for entity 'protein'
Successfully populated database from configuration files.
```

### Database Verification
Confirmed the strategy exists in the database:
```sql
sqlite3 /home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/data/metamapper.db "SELECT name FROM mapping_strategies WHERE name LIKE '%UKBB_TO_HPA%';"
UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT
UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_OPTIMIZED
UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE
```

### Pipeline Script Partially Working
The main pipeline script now:
1. ✅ Successfully connects to the correct database
2. ✅ Finds the strategy in the database
3. ❌ Encounters an import error when executing the strategy actions

## Remaining Issue

While the database path discrepancy has been resolved, a new issue was discovered:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'StrategyAction' from 'biomapper.core.strategy_actions.base'
```

The action implementations have an inconsistency where:
- Base class is named `BaseStrategyAction` in `base.py`
- Some actions try to import `StrategyAction` (without "Base" prefix)

## Conclusion

The primary objective of fixing the database path discrepancy has been **successfully completed**. All components now use a unified database path configuration from `biomapper/config.py`. The strategy is properly loaded into the database and found by the pipeline script.

The import error is a separate issue in the action implementation code that was uncovered during testing but is not related to the database path configuration problem.

## Next Steps

To fully enable the pipeline, the action import issue needs to be resolved by either:
1. Updating all actions to import `BaseStrategyAction` instead of `StrategyAction`
2. Or adding an alias in `base.py`: `StrategyAction = BaseStrategyAction`

This would be a separate task from the database path unification, which has been completed successfully.
