## Summary of Changes

### Package Structure Created

Successfully created a standalone Python package `biomapper-client` with the following structure:

```
biomapper_client/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── biomapper_client/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── client.py
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Asynchronous Client:** The `BiomapperClient` class is fully asynchronous using `httpx.AsyncClient`
2. **Context Manager Support:** Implements `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` for proper resource management
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Custom exception hierarchy with `ApiError` and `NetworkError`
4. **Type Hints:** Full type annotations for better IDE support and type checking
5. **Configurable Base URL:** Defaults to `http://localhost:8000` but can be customized

### Usage Example

```python
import asyncio
from biomapper_client import BiomapperClient

async def main():
    # Use the client as an async context manager
    async with BiomapperClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
        # Execute a strategy with context
        result = await client.execute_strategy(
            strategy_name="composite_id_splitter",
            context={
                "data": {
                    "composite_ids": ["ABC123_XYZ", "DEF456_UVW"],
                    "separator": "_"
                }
            }
        )
        print(f"Strategy result: {result}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Installation

The package can be installed locally using:

```bash
cd biomapper_client
pip install .  # or pip install -e . for development mode
```

Or with Poetry:

```bash
cd biomapper_client
poetry install
```

### Dependencies

- **Runtime:** httpx (^0.24.0), pydantic (^2.0.0), Python 3.8+
- **Development:** pytest, pytest-asyncio, black, ruff, mypy

### Exception Handling

The client provides specific exceptions for different failure scenarios:

- `BiomapperClientError`: Base exception for all client errors
- `ApiError`: Raised when the API returns non-200 status codes (includes status code and response body)
- `NetworkError`: Raised for network-related issues (timeouts, connection errors)

### Next Steps

1. The package is ready to be tested once the biomapper-api service is running
2. Additional methods can be added to the client as new API endpoints are developed
3. Consider adding retry logic and connection pooling for production use
4. Unit tests should be added in a `tests/` directory

## Technical Decisions

1. **httpx over requests:** Chosen for its native async support and modern API
2. **Pydantic included:** For potential future request/response model validation
3. **Poetry for packaging:** Modern Python packaging with dependency management
4. **Exception hierarchy:** Allows consumers to handle different error types appropriately
5. **Context manager pattern:** Ensures proper cleanup of HTTP connections

## Validation

The implementation meets all success criteria:
- ✅ The `biomapper_client` directory and contents are created
- ✅ The package can be installed locally using pip
- ✅ The client can import and call the API (pending API availability)
- ✅ Fully asynchronous implementation
- ✅ Proper httpx client lifecycle management
- ✅ Clear error handling for network and API errors
