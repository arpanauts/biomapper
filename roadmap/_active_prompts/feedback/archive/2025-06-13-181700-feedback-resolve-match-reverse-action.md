# Feedback: Create RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_REVERSE Action Type

**Execution Status:** COMPLETE_SUCCESS

**Execution Date:** 2025-06-13

**Source Prompt:** /home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-13-181700-create-resolve-match-reverse-action.md

## Completed Subtasks

- [x] Create resolve_and_match_reverse.py from template
- [x] Implement reverse resolution logic - resolve target IDs and match to source
- [x] Create comprehensive tests in test_resolve_and_match_reverse.py with full coverage
- [x] Update __init__.py imports
- [x] Add action to MappingExecutor dispatch logic
- [x] Document usage with clear docstrings

## Issues Encountered

1. **One-to-One Mode Logic**: Initial implementation didn't properly enforce one-to-one matching when a target ID resolved to multiple current IDs. Fixed by tracking used sources and targets to ensure each is only matched once.

## Implementation Details

### Action Implementation
Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/resolve_and_match_reverse.py` with:
- Full reverse resolution logic using UniProtHistoricalResolverClient
- Composite identifier handling (split_and_match, match_whole, both strategies)
- Many-to-many and one-to-one matching modes
- Batch processing for API efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed provenance tracking

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Reverse Resolution Logic**: Resolves target IDs via UniProt API and creates reverse lookup
2. **Flexible Matching**: Matches resolved IDs against remaining source identifiers
3. **Context Integration**: Reads from and writes to execution context
4. **Composite Support**: Handles composite identifiers with configurable strategies
5. **Batch Processing**: Processes large ID lists in configurable batches (default 100)

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic reverse resolution and matching
- Composite identifier scenarios
- Many-to-many and one-to-one modes
- Empty input handling
- Parameter validation
- Batch processing verification
- Context append behavior
- Exception handling
- Complex composite scenarios

## Next Action Recommendation

The RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_REVERSE action is now fully implemented and ready for use. Recommended next steps:

1. **Integration Testing**: Test the action within a complete bidirectional mapping strategy
2. **Documentation**: Update ACTION_TYPES_REFERENCE.md to include this new action
3. **Strategy Templates**: Create example YAML strategies that use this action
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets to verify batch processing efficiency

## Confidence Assessment

- **Code Quality**: HIGH - Follows all biomapper conventions and patterns
- **Test Coverage**: HIGH - Comprehensive test suite with all edge cases covered
- **Integration Risk**: LOW - Clean integration with existing architecture
- **Performance**: MEDIUM - Batch processing implemented but not tested at scale

## Environment Changes

### Files Created:
1. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/resolve_and_match_reverse.py` - Main implementation
2. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/test_resolve_and_match_reverse.py` - Test suite

### Files Modified:
1. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/__init__.py` - Added import and export
2. `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` - Added dispatch case

## Lessons Learned

1. **Template Usage**: The action template provided excellent structure and ensured all requirements were met
2. **Reverse Logic Clarity**: The reverse resolution pattern (target→resolve→match to source) is complementary to forward resolution and maximizes match coverage
3. **Composite Handling**: The expansion mapping approach (`_create_expansion_map`) elegantly handles the complexity of tracking which original IDs components came from
4. **Test Design**: Mocking the UniProt client at the `map_identifiers` level provided the right abstraction for testing

## Example Usage

```yaml
action:
  type: "RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_REVERSE"
  input_from: "context.unmatched_hpa"           # Target IDs to resolve
  match_against_remaining: "context.unmatched_ukbb"  # Source IDs to match against
  source_ontology: "PROTEIN_UNIPROTKB_AC_ONTOLOGY"
  resolver: "UNIPROT_HISTORICAL_API"
  append_matched_to: "context.all_matches"
  save_final_unmatched: "context.final_unmatched"
  composite_handling: "split_and_match"
  match_mode: "many_to_many"
  batch_size: 100
```

This action completes the bidirectional mapping capability, allowing strategies to:
1. First try forward resolution (source→resolve→match to target)
2. Then try reverse resolution (target→resolve→match to source)
3. Maximize match coverage when datasets have different versions of UniProt IDs
