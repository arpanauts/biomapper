# Feedback: Refactor MappingExecutor for Action Handling & Fix Registration Error

## Summary of Changes

Successfully refactored the `MappingExecutor` to extract strategy and action handling logic into separate, focused modules. This refactoring resolved the action registration error that was preventing custom action classes (defined via `action_class_path` in YAML) from being loaded.

## Design of New Module(s)

Created three new modules to handle strategy and action management:

### 1. `biomapper.core.action_loader.py`
- **Purpose**: Dynamically loads action classes from either the registry or class paths
- **Key Features**:
  - Lazy loading of action registry
  - Support for both registered actions (by type) and custom actions (by class path)
  - Module caching to avoid redundant imports
  - Comprehensive error handling with clear messages

### 2. `biomapper.core.action_executor.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages individual action execution
- **Key Features**:
  - Parameter processing with context reference resolution
  - Execution context management
  - Result normalization
  - Error handling and logging

### 3. `biomapper.core.strategy_handler.py`
- **Purpose**: High-level strategy orchestration
- **Key Features**:
  - Strategy loading from database
  - Step-by-step execution management
  - Progress callback support
  - Result tracking and statistics

## Bug Fix Details

The original issue was that `MappingExecutor` only supported actions registered in the `ACTION_REGISTRY`, but the YAML configuration specified custom actions via `action_class_path`. The fix involved:

1. **Unified Action Loading**: The `ActionLoader` now checks if an action type exists in the registry first, then attempts to load it as a class path if not found.

2. **Dynamic Import Support**: Implemented dynamic module importing with proper error handling for class path-based actions.

3. **Consistent Interface**: All actions (both registry-based and custom) are instantiated the same way with a database session parameter.

### Modified:
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
  - Added import for `StrategyHandler`
  - Initialized `strategy_handler` in `__init__`
  - Refactored `execute_yaml_strategy` to delegate to `strategy_handler`
  - Removed old `_execute_strategy_action` method

## Test Results

### Unit Tests Created
Created comprehensive unit tests for all new modules:
- `test_action_loader.py`: 10 test cases covering action loading, caching, and error scenarios
- `test_action_executor.py`: 9 test cases covering parameter processing, execution, and error handling
- `test_strategy_handler.py`: 11 test cases covering strategy loading, execution flow, and edge cases

### Integration Test: `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
Successfully executed the script without errors:
```
2025-06-18 04:55:34,199 - __main__ - INFO - Mapping execution completed
2025-06-18 04:55:34,202 - __main__ - INFO - Script completed successfully
```

The script now properly:
1. Loads the strategy from the database
2. Dynamically loads custom action classes
3. Executes actions in sequence
4. Handles empty results gracefully

## Validation

- [x] Action registration error is resolved
- [x] `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` successfully loads and starts executing strategies with `action_class_path` actions
- [x] Relevant sections of `mapping_executor.py` are now delegated to new modules
- [x] Unit tests provide comprehensive coverage
- [x] Code follows established patterns and conventions

## Potential Issues/Risks

1. **Data Loading**: The custom actions created (load_endpoint_identifiers, etc.) are placeholder implementations. They need to be properly implemented to actually load data from endpoints.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code that directly calls `_execute_strategy_action` would break, but a search showed no such usage.

3. **Performance**: The dynamic module loading adds a small overhead, but it's cached after first load.

## Completed Subtasks

- [x] Analyzed `mapping_executor.py` to identify strategy/action handling code
- [x] Designed clean module structure for separation of concerns
- [x] Created new modules with proper interfaces
- [x] Fixed action registration/instantiation error
- [x] Updated `mapping_executor.py` to use new modules
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Tested with `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
- [x] Created placeholder implementations for custom actions

## Issues Encountered

1. **Initial Import Error**: Custom action modules didn't exist, requiring creation of placeholder implementations.

2. **Constructor Mismatch**: Custom actions initially didn't accept the required `db_session` parameter, causing instantiation errors. Fixed by adding proper `__init__` methods.

## Next Action Recommendation

1. **Implement Custom Actions**: The placeholder actions need proper implementation to:
   - Actually load data from endpoints (LoadEndpointIdentifiersAction)
   - Properly reconcile bidirectional results (ReconcileBidirectionalAction)
   - Save results with proper formatting (FormatAndSaveResultsAction)

2. **Continue Refactoring**: Further opportunities exist to extract more logic from `mapping_executor.py`:
   - Path discovery and caching logic
   - Batch processing logic
   - Metrics tracking

3. **Update Documentation**: Update the developer documentation to explain the new architecture and how to create custom actions.

## Confidence Assessment

**High confidence** in the refactoring and fix. The new architecture is cleaner, more maintainable, and successfully resolves the original issue. The separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and extend.

## Environment Changes

- Created new Python modules in `biomapper/core/`
- Created new test files in `tests/unit/core/`
- No configuration or dependency changes required

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dynamic Loading Pattern**: The pattern of checking registry first, then falling back to class path loading provides good flexibility while maintaining backward compatibility.

2. **Clear Separation**: Separating strategy orchestration, action loading, and action execution into distinct modules significantly improves code organization.

3. **Test-Driven Fixes**: Creating comprehensive tests alongside the refactoring helps ensure correctness and provides documentation of expected behavior.

4. **Incremental Progress**: The refactoring enables the script to progress further, revealing the next set of implementation needs (custom action logic).
