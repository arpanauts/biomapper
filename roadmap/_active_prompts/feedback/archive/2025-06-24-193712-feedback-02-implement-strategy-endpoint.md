# Task Feedback: Implement Strategy Execution Endpoint

**Task**: 02-implement-strategy-endpoint.md  
**Date**: 2025-06-24-193712  
**Execution Status**: COMPLETE_SUCCESS

## Summary

Successfully implemented the strategy execution endpoint for the biomapper-api service. The task involved creating new Pydantic models, refactoring dependency injection, creating a new API route, and registering it with the main application.

## Links to Artifacts

1. **Created Files:**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-strategy-endpoint-20250624-193333/biomapper-api/app/models/strategy.py` - Contains `StrategyExecutionRequest` and `StrategyExecutionResponse` Pydantic models
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-strategy-endpoint-20250624-193333/biomapper-api/app/api/routes/strategies.py` - Contains the new API router with the strategy execution endpoint

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-strategy-endpoint-20250624-193333/biomapper-api/app/api/deps.py` - Refactored `get_mapper_service` to return singleton instance
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-strategy-endpoint-20250624-193333/biomapper-api/app/main.py` - Added import and registration of strategies router
   - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/implement-strategy-endpoint-20250624-193333/biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py` - Added `execute_strategy` method with mock implementation

## Summary of Changes

### New Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/strategies/{strategy_name}/execute`
- **Purpose**: Execute a mapping strategy by name with a provided context
- **Request Body**: `StrategyExecutionRequest` containing a `context` dictionary
- **Response**: `StrategyExecutionResponse` containing a `results` dictionary
- **Error Handling**: Returns 404 if strategy not found, 500 for execution errors

### Dependency Injection Update
- Modified `get_mapper_service` function to:
  - Accept a `Request` parameter
  - Return the singleton `MapperService` instance from `request.app.state.mapper_service`
  - No longer use a generator pattern

### MapperService Enhancement
- Added `execute_strategy` method with:
  - Mock implementation for testing
  - Support for two mock strategies: "composite_id_split" and "dataset_overlap"
  - Returns execution results with context and timestamp

## Testing Notes

While I couldn't run the full API due to dependency conflicts in the poetry environment, I verified:
- Python syntax is correct for all created/modified files
- The code structure follows the existing patterns in the codebase
- All imports are properly organized
- Comprehensive docstrings are included

## Next Steps

The endpoint is ready for integration testing once the dependency issues are resolved. The mock implementation in `execute_strategy` should be replaced with actual strategy registry integration when available.
