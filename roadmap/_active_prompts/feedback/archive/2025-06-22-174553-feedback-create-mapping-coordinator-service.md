# Feedback: Create MappingCoordinatorService

**Task Completed:** 2025-06-22-174553  
**Source Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-22-171743-prompt-create-mapping-coordinator-service.md`

## Summary

Successfully created the `MappingCoordinatorService` as specified in the task requirements. The service consolidates high-level mapping orchestration logic from `MappingExecutor`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Created
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/mapping_coordinator_service.py`
- **Status:** ✅ Created successfully

### 2. Class Structure
- **Class Name:** `MappingCoordinatorService`
- **Constructor:** Accepts `IterativeExecutionService` and `MappingPathExecutionService` as dependencies
- **Logger:** Optional logger parameter with default fallback

### 3. Methods Implemented

#### `execute_mapping` (formerly in MappingExecutor)
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully moved from MappingExecutor
- **Logic:** Preserved - delegates to `IterativeExecutionService.execute()`
- **Parameters:** All parameters maintained from original method
- **Return Type:** Dict[str, Any] as per original

#### `execute_path` (formerly `_execute_path` in MappingExecutor)
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully moved and renamed
- **Name Change:** `_execute_path` → `execute_path` (now public method)
- **Logic:** Preserved - delegates to `MappingPathExecutionService.execute_path()`
- **Parameters:** All parameters maintained from original method
- **Return Type:** Dict[str, Optional[Dict[str, Any]]] as per original

### 4. Imports
All necessary imports were added to the new file:
- `logging` for logger functionality
- Type hints from `typing`
- `AsyncSession` from SQLAlchemy
- Required models and services:
  - `ReversiblePath`
  - `IterativeExecutionService`
  - `MappingPathExecutionService`
  - `MappingPath`

## Success Criteria Validation

### ✅ Criteria Met:
1. **File exists:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/mapping_coordinator_service.py` created successfully
2. **Class contains methods:** Both `execute_mapping` and `execute_path` methods are present
3. **Logic is identical:** The logic from the original methods was preserved - both methods delegate to their respective services exactly as the original implementation did

## Technical Notes

1. **Delegation Pattern:** The service follows a clean delegation pattern, forwarding calls to specialized execution services
2. **No Logic Changes:** The implementation preserves the exact logic from MappingExecutor - no functional changes were made
3. **Public Method:** The `_execute_path` method was renamed to `execute_path` as requested, making it a public method of the service
4. **Dependency Injection:** The service uses constructor injection for its dependencies, promoting testability and loose coupling

## Next Steps

The MappingExecutor class will need to be updated to:
1. Instantiate `MappingCoordinatorService` with the required dependencies
2. Update `execute_mapping` to delegate to `mapping_coordinator_service.execute_mapping()`
3. Update `_execute_path` to delegate to `mapping_coordinator_service.execute_path()`

This refactoring successfully extracts the high-level orchestration logic into a dedicated service, improving the separation of concerns in the codebase.
