# Feedback: Verify qdrant-client Installation and Update Import

**Task Completion Date:** 2025-05-30 17:54:05 UTC  
**Source Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-05-30-174505-install-qdrant-client.md`

## Summary

Successfully verified that `qdrant-client` is correctly installed in the Poetry environment and uncommented the relevant import statement.

## Confirmation of qdrant-client Installation

### Poetry Installation Status
- Ran `poetry install --sync` which confirmed all dependencies are already installed:
  ```
  Installing dependencies from lock file
  
  No dependencies to install or update
  
  Installing the current project: biomapper (0.5.2)
  The `--sync` option is deprecated and slated for removal in the next minor release after June 2025, use the `poetry sync` command instead.
  ```

### Import Verification
- Successfully verified qdrant_client can be imported in the Poetry environment:
  ```bash
  $ poetry run python -c "import qdrant_client; print('qdrant_client imported successfully')"
  qdrant_client imported successfully
  ```

## Import Statement Update

### File Location Correction
- The file specified in the instructions (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/biomapper/mapping_strategies.py`) does not exist
- Located the actual commented import in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/__init__.py`

### Changes Made
Successfully uncommented the PubChemRAGMappingClient import statement.

**File:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/__init__.py`

**Diff:**
```diff
-# from .pubchem_rag_client import PubChemRAGMappingClient  # Commented out - requires qdrant_client
+from .pubchem_rag_client import PubChemRAGMappingClient
```

## Issues Encountered

1. **File Path Discrepancy:** The instructions referenced `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/biomapper/mapping_strategies.py`, but this file does not exist. Used grep search to locate the actual commented qdrant_client import in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/__init__.py`.

## Verification of Completed Changes

The uncommented import allows the PubChemRAGMappingClient to be imported along with other mapping clients, preparing the codebase for potential RAG-based mapping work.

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All deliverables have been met:
- ✅ Confirmed qdrant-client is correctly installed/available in Poetry environment
- ✅ Confirmed import statement was uncommented (in correct file location)
- ✅ Provided diff of changes
- ✅ Documented issues encountered (file path discrepancy)
