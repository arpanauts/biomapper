# Feedback: Fix MappingExecutor Path Selection Logic

## Date: 2025-05-29 18:00:00 UTC

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the fix for the MappingExecutor path selection logic to properly prioritize relationship-specific mapping paths based on the `priority` field.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the incorrect path selection was that the `MappingExecutor._find_direct_paths` method was finding paths based solely on ontology types (source_type and target_type), without considering the relationship between endpoints. This meant it would find ALL paths that match the ontology types across the entire database, not just the ones associated with the specific endpoint relationship defined in the `RelationshipMappingPath` table.

For the UKBB to HPA mapping case:
- There were likely multiple paths with `source_type="UNIPROTKB_AC"` and `target_type="UNIPROTKB_AC"` (identity paths)
- The new `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` path (with `priority=1`) was defined specifically for the UKBB-HPA relationship
- However, the executor was finding and using generic identity paths instead of the relationship-specific ones

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Imports
- Added `EndpointRelationship` and `RelationshipMappingPath` to the imports from `..db.models`

### 2. Created New Method: `_find_paths_for_relationship`
- This method specifically queries for paths associated with an EndpointRelationship
- It joins `MappingPath` with `RelationshipMappingPath` and `EndpointRelationship`
- Filters paths by:
  - The specific relationship ID between two endpoints
  - Matching source and target ontologies
  - Active paths only
- Orders results by priority (ascending, so lower numbers = higher priority)

### 3. Modified `_find_best_path` Method
- Added optional parameters: `source_endpoint` and `target_endpoint`
- These parameters are passed down to `_find_mapping_paths`

### 4. Modified `_find_mapping_paths` Method
- Added optional parameters: `source_endpoint` and `target_endpoint`
- Implemented logic to:
  1. First check for relationship-specific paths when endpoints are provided
  2. Use `_find_paths_for_relationship` to find paths specific to the endpoint relationship
  3. If relationship-specific paths are found, use only those (respecting priority)
  4. If no relationship-specific paths are found, fall back to the general path search

### 5. Updated Method Calls
- Updated the call to `_find_best_path` in `execute_mapping` to pass the endpoint objects
- Also updated the bidirectional validation call to include endpoints (with source/target swapped for reverse)

## How This Ensures Correct Path Selection

With these changes:

1. When mapping from UKBB_Protein to HPA_Protein, the executor will:
   - First look for paths specifically defined for the UKBB->HPA relationship
   - Find the `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` path with `priority=1`
   - Use this path instead of any generic identity paths

2. The priority system now works as intended:
   - Paths are properly filtered to only those relevant to the specific endpoint relationship
   - Among those paths, the one with the lowest priority number (highest priority) is selected

3. For relationships without specific paths defined, the system falls back to the general path search, maintaining backward compatibility

## Assumptions Made

1. The `EndpointRelationship` table has proper entries linking source and target endpoints
2. The `RelationshipMappingPath` table correctly links relationships to their specific paths
3. The priority field in `MappingPath` uses lower numbers for higher priority (which is confirmed by the existing `order_by(MappingPath.priority.asc())`)

## Potential Side Effects Considered

1. **Performance**: The new logic adds an additional database query when endpoints are available, but this is mitigated by:
   - Only executing when endpoints are provided
   - The existing caching mechanism still applies
   - The query is well-indexed through foreign keys

2. **Backward Compatibility**: The changes are fully backward compatible:
   - If no endpoints are provided, the original behavior is maintained
   - If no relationship-specific paths exist, it falls back to general path search

3. **Logging**: Enhanced logging has been added to clearly show when relationship-specific paths are being used vs. general paths

## Testing Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. Running `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py --drop-all` to recreate the database
2. Running `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` to test the UKBB to HPA mapping
3. Observing the logs to confirm that `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` is selected instead of an identity path

The logs should show messages like:
- "Checking for relationship-specific paths between endpoints X and Y"
- "Found N relationship-specific mapping path(s) for relationship Z"
- "Using N relationship-specific path(s)"
- Path selection showing the gene name path with priority 1
