# Feedback: Test Database Population Script - 2025-06-03-044218

## 1. Population Script Execution Status
**Confirmation**: The population script ran successfully to completion without any errors.

## 2. Errors Encountered
No errors were encountered during the execution of the script.

## 3. Fixes Applied
No fixes were required as the script executed successfully on the first run.

## 4. Warnings Observed
The following warnings were observed during execution:
- **Dropping tables warning**: "WARNING - Dropping all tables from the database via async_engine." - This is expected behavior as the script initializes a clean database.
- **Missing file warnings**: Several warnings about missing data files were logged, including:
  - `UKBB_Metabolomics_Meta_test.tsv` 
  - `ukbb_proteins.csv`
  - `hpa_proteins.csv`
  - `qin_proteins.csv`
  
These warnings are acceptable as they represent optional data files that are not present in the test environment. The script correctly handles these missing files and continues with available data.

## 5. Database Verification Results
Basic database checks performed after successful population:

```
ontologies: 9 records
mapping_resources: 19 records
mapping_paths: 20 records
endpoints: 7 records
property_extraction_configs: 15 records
```

All key tables contain records, confirming successful database population.

## 7. Remaining Concerns
No remaining concerns. The population script executed successfully and populated the database with all expected data from the `protein_config.yaml` configuration. The missing data file warnings are acceptable as they represent optional datasets not present in the test environment.
