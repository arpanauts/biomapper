# Feedback: Debug ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper.types

**Date:** 2025-06-18 11:54:39 UTC  
**Task:** Debug and fix ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper.types  
**Source Prompt:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-114900-debug-modulenotfound-biomapper-types.md`

## Execution Status
**PARTIAL_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] Read and analyzed the task prompt requirements
- [x] Examined the path_execution_manager.py file at line 20
- [x] Verified that the import statement has already been corrected from `from biomapper.types import PathExecutionStatus` to `from biomapper.db.cache_models import PathExecutionStatus`
- [x] Ran the test script to validate the fix
- [x] Identified that the original ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper.types has been resolved

## Issues Encountered
1. **Primary Issue Resolved:** The import error for `biomapper.types` was already fixed prior to this task execution. The import statement in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` line 20 correctly shows:
   ```python
   from biomapper.db.cache_models import PathExecutionStatus
   ```

2. **New Issue Discovered:** When running the test script, a different ModuleNotFoundError emerged:
   ```
   File "/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py", line 21, in <module>
     from biomapper.utils.logging import get_logger
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.utils.logging'
   ```

3. **Investigation Result:** A search for logging-related files revealed that no `logging.py` file exists in the biomapper/utils directory or anywhere else in the project.

## Next Action Recommendation
1. **Immediate Action:** Create a new prompt to address the missing `biomapper.utils.logging` module. This requires either:
   - Creating the missing logging.py module with a get_logger function
   - OR finding where get_logger is actually defined and updating the import
   - OR removing the logging dependency if it's not essential

2. **Follow-up:** After fixing the logging import, continue testing to ensure no other import errors exist in the execution chain.

## Confidence Assessment
- **Quality:** HIGH - The original task was correctly identified as already complete
- **Testing Coverage:** MEDIUM - Successfully tested the script execution and caught the next error in the chain
- **Risk Level:** LOW - No destructive changes were made; the system state remains stable

## Environment Changes
- No files were modified during this task execution
- No new files were created
- No permissions were changed
- The git status shows the file remains in its modified state from a previous change

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always verify current state:** The task prompt indicated an error that had already been fixed, highlighting the importance of checking the current state before making changes.

2. **Cascading import errors:** Fixing one import error often reveals additional import issues downstream. A comprehensive import audit might be beneficial.

3. **Missing utility modules:** The project appears to be missing some utility modules (like logging) that are referenced in the code. This suggests either incomplete refactoring or missing files from version control.

4. **Test early and often:** Running the script immediately after verifying the fix helped identify the next issue in the chain quickly.

## Additional Notes
- The PathExecutionStatus import has been successfully migrated from `biomapper.types` to `biomapper.db.cache_models`
- The project structure suggests ongoing refactoring, with imports needing updates across multiple files
- Consider creating a systematic approach to identify and fix all import issues at once
