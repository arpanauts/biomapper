# Feedback: MVP UKBB NMR to Arivale Chemistries Mapping Implementation

**Date:** 2025-05-23
**Time (UTC):** 23:27:00

## Summary of Work Completed

Successfully implemented the MVP for UKBB NMR to Arivale Chemistries mapping using direct name matching. All requested tasks have been completed.

## Confirmation of Deliverables

### 1. Python Script Created
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/mvp_ukbb_arivale_chemistries/map_ukbb_to_arivale_chemistries.py`
- **Status:** Created and made executable
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Data loading with comment line handling for Arivale file
  - Simple name normalization (lowercase + trim)
  - Direct name matching (Display Name first, then Name)
  - TSV output generation
  - Summary statistics reporting
  - Comprehensive logging

### 2. Output File Generated
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/output/ukbb_to_arivale_chemistries_mapping.tsv`
- **Status:** Successfully generated with correct format
- **Log File:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/output/ukbb_arivale_chemistries_mapping.log`

## Actual Arivale Chemistries Column Names

The actual column names found in `chemistries_metadata.tsv` differ from those documented in the spec:

**Documented (in spec):**
- TestId, TestDisplayName, TestName, Units, Loinccode, Pubchem

**Actual (in data file):**
- Name
- Display Name
- Labcorp ID
- Labcorp Name
- Labcorp LOINC ID
- Labcorp LOINC Name
- Quest ID
- Quest Name
- Quest LOINC ID

The script was adapted to use the actual column names, with mapping performed against "Display Name" (primary) and "Name" (secondary).

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

1. **Column Name Discrepancy:** The documented column names in the spec did not match the actual data file. Resolution: Analyzed the actual data file and adapted the implementation to use the correct column names.

2. **Comment Lines in Arivale File:** The Arivale file contains 13 lines of metadata comments starting with '#'. Resolution: Implemented comment line filtering in the data loading function.

## Assumptions Made

1. **Column Mapping:** Assumed that:
   - "Display Name" in actual data corresponds to "TestDisplayName" in spec
   - "Name" in actual data corresponds to "TestName" in spec

2. **Normalization:** Used simple normalization (lowercase + trim) as specified, no additional cleaning

3. **NA Values:** Treated "NA" values in Arivale data as empty strings for matching purposes

## Summary Statistics

### Mapping Results:
- **Total UKBB entries processed:** 251
- **Matched:** 7 (2.8%)
  - All matches were on "display_name" field
- **Unmatched:** 244 (97.2%)

### Successfully Matched Entries:
1. Total cholesterol → Total cholesterol
2. LDL cholesterol → LDL cholesterol
3. HDL cholesterol → HDL cholesterol
4. Linoleic acid → Linoleic Acid
5. Glucose → Glucose
6. Creatinine → Creatinine
7. Albumin → Albumin

## New Dependencies

No new dependencies were required. The implementation uses only Python standard library modules:
- argparse
- csv
- logging
- os
- sys
- collections.defaultdict
- pathlib.Path
- typing

## Questions and Points for Clarification

1. **Low Match Rate:** The 2.8% match rate is quite low. Is this expected for the MVP, or should we investigate additional normalization strategies?

2. **Column Name Documentation:** Should the spec be updated to reflect the actual column names in the Arivale data file?

3. **Multiple Lab Providers:** The Arivale data includes information from both Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics. Should future iterations consider matching against lab-specific names as well?

4. **Case Sensitivity:** Some matches might be missed due to case differences (e.g., "Linoleic acid" vs "Linoleic Acid"). Should we consider more sophisticated normalization?

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. Review the unmatched entries to identify patterns that could improve matching
2. Consider fuzzy matching or partial string matching for future iterations
3. Explore matching against lab-specific names (Labcorp Name, Quest Name)
4. Update documentation to reflect actual data structure
