# Feedback: Merge Conflict Resolution for Refactor MappingExecutor Task

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS** (Task completed, but merge conflict exists)

## Situation Analysis
The refactoring task was successfully completed in the worktree branch `task/refactor-executor-facade-20250622-205640`. However, when attempting to merge into main, conflicts were encountered because:

1. Another branch (`task/create-mapping-executor-builder-20250622-205618`) was already merged into main
2. That branch created the same files we created:
   - `biomapper/core/engine_components/mapping_executor_builder.py`
   - `tests/core/engine_components/test_mapping_executor_builder.py`

## Conflict Details
- **Files in conflict**: 
  - `biomapper/core/engine_components/mapping_executor_builder.py`
  - `tests/core/engine_components/test_mapping_executor_builder.py`
- **Reason**: Both branches created the MappingExecutorBuilder class independently
- **Main branch status**: Already 8 commits ahead of origin/main

## Resolution Strategy
Since the MappingExecutorBuilder already exists in main, the resolution strategy should be:

1. **Review the existing MappingExecutorBuilder** in main to understand its implementation
2. **Identify unique changes** from our branch that enhance the executor refactoring
3. **Cherry-pick or manually apply** only the MappingExecutor refactoring changes:
   - Changes to `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` (simplified constructor)
   - Updates to test fixtures
   - Any unique enhancements to the builder

## Recommended Actions
1. **Option 1 - Cherry-pick approach**:
   ```bash
   # From main branch
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash-for-mapping-executor-changes>
   ```

2. **Option 2 - Manual merge**:
   - Keep the existing MappingExecutorBuilder from main
   - Manually apply the MappingExecutor refactoring changes
   - Ensure compatibility between the existing builder and refactored executor

3. **Option 3 - Create new branch**:
   - Create a new branch from updated main
   - Apply only the MappingExecutor refactoring changes
   - Submit as a separate PR

## Task Completion Status
Despite the merge conflict, the task objectives were fully achieved:
- ✅ MappingExecutor refactored to pure facade
- ✅ All component creation moved to builder
- ✅ High-level coordinators properly integrated
- ✅ Tests updated and passing
- ✅ Code quality verified

The merge conflict is a process issue, not a technical failure of the implementation.
