## Issues Encountered

None. All tasks completed successfully without errors.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. New SOA Starter Prompt (`_soa_starter_prompt.md`)

The new starter prompt has been comprehensively updated to reflect the service-oriented architecture:

**Key Additions:**
- **Service Architecture Guidelines**: Clear explanation of the three main components (biomapper-api, biomapper core, biomapper-ui)
- **API-First Development**: Emphasis on using the RESTful API for all mapping executions
- **API Endpoint Documentation**: Listed key endpoints with examples
- **Service Integration Patterns**: Async operations, error handling, progress monitoring
- **SOA-Specific Error Classifications**: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, CONFIGURATION_MISMATCH, etc.
- **Enhanced Prompt Template**: Includes service architecture context, API integration patterns, and deployment considerations
- **Migration Guidance**: Instructions for transitioning from notebook to service-based workflows

**Retained Elements:**
- Core orchestration responsibilities
- StrategyAction development guide (updated for SOA context)
- Prompt generation and execution workflow
- Error recovery and context management principles

### 2. Notebook to Service Conversion Plan (`notebook_to_service_plan.md`)

Created a comprehensive plan for converting the UKBB to HPA protein mapping notebook:

**Plan Components:**
- **Current State Analysis**: Documented notebook structure and operations
- **Required Strategy Actions**: Identified three new actions needed (CompositeIdSplitter, DatasetOverlapAnalyzer, LoadLocalData)
- **YAML Strategy Definition**: Complete strategy configuration for the overlap analysis
- **API Client Implementation**: Full Python client with async operations and progress tracking
- **Integration Testing**: Test framework for validating the service-based workflow
- **4-Week Implementation Timeline**: Phased approach from core development to production deployment
- **Benefits Documentation**: Clear articulation of why service-based approach is superior

## Next Action Recommendation

1. **Review and Approve Documents**: Have the USER review both documents for accuracy and completeness
2. **Implement New Strategy Actions**: Begin development of the three identified actions in the core library
3. **Deploy API Updates**: Update the biomapper-api service with new strategy configurations
4. **Create API Client SDK**: Develop a formal Python SDK for biomapper-api interactions
5. **Document API Changes**: Update API documentation with new endpoints and strategies

- **Notebook Conversion Plan**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/.worktrees/task/evaluate-starter-prompt-20250624-142704/roadmap/notebook_to_service_plan.md`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Service Boundaries Are Critical**: The new architecture requires clear separation between API, core library, and UI components
2. **API-First Mindset**: All external interactions should go through the biomapper-api, not direct library usage
3. **Progress Tracking**: Long-running operations need proper progress reporting via API
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must consider existing API consumers
5. **Documentation Is Key**: Clear examples and migration guides are essential for adoption

## Quality Assessment

- **Completeness**: All requested deliverables created with comprehensive content
- **Clarity**: Documents use clear language and concrete examples
- **Actionability**: Specific implementation steps and code examples provided
- **Alignment**: Fully aligned with service-oriented architecture principles
- **Future-Proofing**: Includes migration paths and enhancement suggestions
