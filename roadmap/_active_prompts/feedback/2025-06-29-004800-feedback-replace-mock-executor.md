# Feedback: Replace Mock Executor with Real Biomapper Engine

## Execution Status
**PARTIAL_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] Removed all `biomapper_mock` imports from `mapper_service.py`
- [x] Replaced with real `biomapper` imports
- [x] Fixed import path issues:
  - `biomapper.io.util` â†’ `biomapper.utils.io_utils`
  - Removed non-existent `BiomapperContext` import
- [x] Resolved async initialization issues in FastAPI context
- [x] Updated strategy execution to use `MappingExecutor.execute_yaml_strategy()`
- [x] Created database population scripts:
  - `scripts/populate_yaml_strategy.py` - Loads YAML strategies into database
  - `scripts/populate_endpoints.py` - Creates required endpoints
- [x] Successfully populated database with:
  - UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS strategy (4 steps)
  - UKBB_PROTEIN_ASSAY_ID and HPA_GENE_NAME endpoints
- [x] Achieved end-to-end execution of real biomapper engine through API

## Issues Encountered
1. **Strategy Not Found in Database**: The biomapper engine expects strategies to be in the database, but the API was only loading them from YAML files. Required creating a population script.

2. **Endpoint Not Found**: The strategy execution required endpoints to be defined in the database. Had to create and populate endpoint records.

3. **Async Context Issues**: Initial attempt to use `asyncio.run()` within FastAPI's existing event loop failed. Resolved by deferring executor initialization.

4. **Model Field Mismatches**: 
   - YAML strategies use `name` field for steps, not `step_id`
   - Endpoint model doesn't have `url` field, uses `connection_details` instead

5. **No Mapping Results**: The LOCAL_ID_CONVERTER action returns "empty_input", suggesting potential data format mismatches or missing configuration.

## Next Action Recommendation
1. **Investigate Empty Results**: Debug why LOCAL_ID_CONVERTER is skipping with "empty_input" despite valid input identifiers and existing mapping file.

2. **Complete Strategy Configuration**: The strategy may need additional configuration or data population to work correctly.

3. **Consider Direct YAML Loading**: Explore implementing a way to execute YAML strategies without requiring database population, which would simplify deployment.

4. **Add Integration Tests**: Create tests that verify the end-to-end flow with sample data.

## Confidence Assessment
- **Code Quality**: HIGH - Clean integration following existing patterns
- **Testing Coverage**: LOW - No automated tests added for the integration
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Database population adds deployment complexity

## Environment Changes
- **Files Created:**
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_yaml_strategy.py`
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_endpoints.py`
  
- **Files Modified:**
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py`
  
- **Database Changes:**
  - Added UKBB_HPA_PROTEIN_OVERLAP_ANALYSIS strategy with 4 steps
  - Added UKBB_PROTEIN_ASSAY_ID and HPA_GENE_NAME endpoints

## Lessons Learned
1. **Architecture Mismatch**: The biomapper engine is designed to load strategies from the database, while the API service loads them from YAML. This creates a deployment complexity that should be addressed architecturally.

2. **Deferred Initialization Pattern**: When integrating async libraries with FastAPI, deferring initialization until first use (rather than during startup) avoids event loop conflicts.

3. **Database Schema Documentation**: Better documentation of database models would have prevented the field mismatch issues.

4. **Strategy Execution Layers**: The biomapper engine has multiple layers for strategy execution:
   - `MappingExecutor.execute_yaml_strategy()`
   - `StrategyCoordinatorService.execute_yaml_strategy()`
   - `YamlStrategyExecutionService.execute()`
   - `StrategyOrchestrator.execute_strategy()`
   
   Understanding this hierarchy was crucial for proper integration.

5. **Data Dependencies**: The strategy execution depends on properly configured endpoints and data files being available at specific paths. This creates deployment dependencies that should be documented.

## Recommendations for Future Work
1. Implement a hybrid approach where YAML strategies can be executed directly without database population
2. Add comprehensive logging for strategy action execution to aid debugging
3. Create a strategy validation tool that checks all dependencies before execution
4. Document the full data flow from API request to biomapper engine execution
