# Feedback: Debug and Fix Silent API Server Startup Failure

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] Identified the root cause of silent API startup failure (missing `structlog` dependency)
- [x] Found incorrect path reference in biomapper-api/pyproject.toml
- [x] Fixed the path reference from absolute `/home/ubuntu/biomapper` to relative `..`
- [x] Installed missing `structlog` dependency in the main poetry environment
- [x] Installed `biomapper-client` package in editable mode
- [x] Successfully started the API server with proper logging output
- [x] Verified client script can connect and execute strategies through the API

## Issues Encountered
1. **ModuleNotFoundError for structlog**: Despite being listed in biomapper-api/pyproject.toml, the module wasn't installed in the active poetry environment
2. **Path discrepancy**: The biomapper-api's pyproject.toml had an incorrect absolute path pointing to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper` instead of using a relative path
3. **Poetry dependency resolution timeouts**: Attempts to use `poetry lock` and `poetry add` were taking too long, requiring a workaround
4. **Missing biomapper-client installation**: The client package wasn't installed in the environment

## Next Action Recommendation
1. Consider updating the project setup documentation to clarify the installation process for sub-packages
2. May want to consolidate dependencies or create a proper monorepo setup with workspace dependencies
3. The mock implementation in `MapperServiceForStrategies.execute_strategy()` should eventually be replaced with actual strategy execution logic

## Confidence Assessment
- **Quality**: High - The solution addresses the root cause and the server now starts reliably
- **Testing Coverage**: Good - Tested both server startup and client-server communication
- **Risk Level**: Low - Changes were minimal and focused on dependency management

## Environment Changes
- Modified `/home/trentleslie/github/biomapper/biomapper-api/pyproject.toml` (fixed path reference)
- Installed `structlog` package via pip in the poetry environment
- Installed `biomapper-client` package in editable mode
- No new files created
- No permission changes

## Lessons Learned
1. **Silent failures often occur during imports**: When a FastAPI/uvicorn server exits silently, check for import errors that occur before logging is configured
2. **Poetry sub-projects can have dependency isolation issues**: Dependencies listed in sub-project pyproject.toml files may not be automatically available in the parent environment
3. **Direct pip installation can be a valid workaround**: When poetry dependency resolution is slow or problematic, using `poetry run pip install` can be an effective alternative
4. **Debug print statements are valuable**: The existing debug prints in the code helped trace the initialization flow
5. **Path references in pyproject.toml should use relative paths**: This makes the project portable across different environments
