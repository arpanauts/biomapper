# Feedback: Complete InitializationService Integration with MappingExecutor

**Task Reference:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-22-171741-prompt-create-initialization-service.md`

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] InitializationService already existed in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/initialization_service.py`
- [x] Updated MappingExecutor.__init__ to use InitializationService instead of direct initialization
- [x] Removed the direct initialization logic from MappingExecutor.__init__
- [x] Verified Python syntax for both mapping_executor.py and initialization_service.py
- [x] All components are now initialized through InitializationService.initialize_components()

## Implementation Details

### MappingExecutor Refactoring
The MappingExecutor.__init__ method has been successfully refactored to:
1. **Create an InitializationService instance**: `initialization_service = InitializationService()`
2. **Call initialize_components**: Pass all configuration parameters and pre-initialized components
3. **Assign components from returned dictionary**: All components are now assigned from the dictionary returned by initialize_components
4. **Maintain backward compatibility**: All convenience references and configuration attributes are properly set

### Key Changes Made
1. **Removed duplicate initialization logic**: The complex if/else block for legacy vs component mode is now handled entirely within InitializationService
2. **Simplified component assignment**: All components are assigned from the returned dictionary
3. **Cleaner code structure**: MappingExecutor.__init__ is now much more concise and focused

### Files Modified
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: Updated __init__ method to use InitializationService

## Issues Encountered
**None** - The refactoring was completed successfully without any errors.

## Verification Results
- Python syntax check passed for both files
- All imports are properly in place
- InitializationService already had all necessary imports from the previous implementation

## Next Action Recommendation
The task has been completed successfully. The InitializationService now encapsulates all component initialization logic, and MappingExecutor has been updated to use it. This provides:

1. **Better separation of concerns**: Initialization logic is now separate from the facade
2. **Improved maintainability**: Changes to initialization can be made in one place
3. **Cleaner MappingExecutor**: The facade is now truly lean and focused on delegation

No further action is required for this task. The implementation is complete and ready for testing.
