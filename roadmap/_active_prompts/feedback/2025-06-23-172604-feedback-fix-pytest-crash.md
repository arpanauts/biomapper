# Feedback: Fix Pytest Crash in `test_cache_results_db_error_during_commit`

**Task Reference:** `/home/trentleslie/github/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-24-002209-fix-pytest-crash-in-mapping-executor-test.md`  
**Execution Date:** 2025-06-23T17:26:04

## Execution Status
**COMPLETE_SUCCESS**

## Completed Subtasks
- [X] Located and read the target file `/home/trentleslie/github/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`
- [X] Verified that the fix was already applied to `test_cache_results_db_error_during_commit` function
- [X] Ran `poetry run pytest` to validate the fix - test suite now completes without crashing
- [X] Created this feedback file to document the results

## Issues Encountered
The fix specified in the prompt had already been applied to the code. The test function `test_cache_results_db_error_during_commit` at lines 1016-1068 already contained the corrected SQLAlchemy `OperationalError` instantiation and improved async session mock implementation.

## Next Action Recommendation
The fix is already applied and validated. The pytest crash issue has been resolved - the test suite now runs to completion. While there are other failing tests in the file (11 failures), these are unrelated to the crash issue and the specific test `test_cache_results_db_error_during_commit` is passing. Ready for the next task.

## Confidence Assessment
**High**

The crash issue has been definitively resolved. The test suite runs to completion and the specific test that was causing the crash is now passing.

## Environment Changes
No changes were made to the file `tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` as the fix was already present.

## Lessons Learned
The incorrect exception instantiation (passing `{}` instead of `None` for the params argument to SQLAlchemy's `OperationalError`) was indeed the cause of the crash. The fix correctly instantiates the exception with `None` for the params argument and properly sets up the async context manager mock, allowing the test to run successfully.
