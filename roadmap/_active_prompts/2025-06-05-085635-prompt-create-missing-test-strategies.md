# Prompt: Create Missing Test Strategy Definitions for Optional Step Tests

**Objective:** Resolve 7 test failures in `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` by creating and loading the missing YAML strategy definitions required for tests involving optional steps.

**Context:**
The final comprehensive test run (feedback `2025-06-05-085420-feedback-final-comprehensive-test-analysis.md`) identified that 7 tests are failing with errors indicating that the strategy definition (e.g., `optional_fail_first_strategy`) was not found in the database. These tests specifically relate to scenarios with optional strategy steps.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Identify Missing Strategy Names:**
    *   Consult the `final_full_integration_test_run_20250605_084500.log` (mentioned in feedback `2025-06-05-085420-...`) to get the exact names of the strategies that are reported as "not found."
    *   These are likely to include names like `optional_fail_first_strategy`, `optional_fail_last_strategy`, `all_optional_fail_strategy`, etc., which were previously failing due to parameter issues but now fail because their definitions aren't loaded.

2.  **Locate or Create YAML Strategy Files:**
    *   **Check Existing Files:** The YAML definitions for these strategies might already exist in `tests/integration/data/strategies/` (e.g., in `test_optional_steps_config.yaml` or similar) but are not being loaded by test fixtures.
    *   **Create New Files/Entries:** If the YAML definitions for these specific strategies do not exist, they need to be created. The structure should be similar to other strategy YAML files, defining steps, actions, and parameters. The test names themselves (e.g., `test_optional_fail_first_strategy`) provide strong clues about the intended behavior and structure of these strategies (e.g., an optional step that is expected to fail, followed by other steps).

3.  **Ensure Strategies are Loaded by Fixtures:**
    *   The primary task is to ensure that these strategy definitions are loaded into the test database before the relevant tests run.
    *   This typically happens in a fixture within `tests/integration/conftest.py` (e.g., in `populated_db` or a fixture that specifically loads strategies from YAML files into `MappingStrategy` and `MappingStrategyStep` tables).
    *   Modify the fixture(s) responsible for loading strategies to include these newly identified or created YAML strategy definitions.
    *   If strategies are created programmatically in fixtures instead of from YAML, then the programmatic creation logic needs to be extended for these optional step strategies.

**Affected Tests (7 tests, primarily in `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`):**

*   These are the tests failing with "Strategy <strategy_name> not found in the database" or similar errors. The exact list should be retrieved from the test log.
    *   Likely candidates based on previous context: `test_all_optional_strategy`, `test_mixed_required_optional_strategy`, `test_optional_fail_first_strategy`, `test_optional_fail_last_strategy`, `test_multiple_optional_failures_strategy`, `test_required_fail_after_optional_strategy`, `test_all_optional_fail_strategy`.

**Verification:**

*   After creating/locating the YAML files and ensuring they are loaded by fixtures, re-run the 7 tests identified as failing due to missing strategy definitions.
*   Confirm that these tests no longer fail with "strategy not found" errors. They should now proceed further (and hopefully pass, assuming the strategy logic itself is sound and other dependencies like endpoint configs are met).

**Deliverables:**

*   Any new or modified YAML strategy files (e.g., in `tests/integration/data/strategies/`).
*   Modified Python fixture files (e.g., `tests/integration/conftest.py`) that now load these strategies.
*   A clear explanation of which strategies were missing and how they were added/loaded.
*   Confirmation (e.g., pytest console output snippets) that the 7 targeted tests no longer report missing strategies.

**Environment:**

*   Assume test fixture enhancements for endpoint/CSV configurations (from prompt `...-fix-test-fixtures-endpoint-csv.md`) are being addressed, as these strategies will rely on correctly configured endpoints.
