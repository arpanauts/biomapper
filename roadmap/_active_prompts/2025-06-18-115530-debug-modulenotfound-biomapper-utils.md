# Prompt: Debug ModuleNotFoundError for biomapper.utils

**Task Objective:**
Resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.utils.logging'` that occurs when executing the main mapping pipeline. This error is caused by the removal of the `biomapper.utils` module during refactoring. The fix is to replace the custom `get_logger` and `get_current_utc_time` functions with their standard Python library equivalents.

**Prerequisites:**
- The file `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` must exist and be writable.

**Input Context:**
1.  **File to Modify:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py`
2.  **Error Traceback:**
    ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py", line 52, in <module>
        from biomapper.core import MappingExecutor
      ...
      File "/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py", line 21, in <module>
        from biomapper.utils.logging import get_logger
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.utils.logging'
    ```
3.  **Investigation Finding:** The entire `biomapper.utils` module, including `logging.py` and `time_helpers.py`, has been removed. The code must be updated to use the standard `logging` and `datetime` libraries.

**Expected Outputs:**
- The file `path_execution_manager.py` will be modified to use standard libraries for logging and timestamping.
- A confirmation message stating that the file was successfully updated.

**Success Criteria:**
- After the change, executing `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` from the project root (`/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`) no longer raises the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `biomapper.utils.logging`.

**Error Recovery Instructions:**
- If you do not have permission to write to the file, report a file permission error.
- If the changes cause a new `ImportError` or `NameError`, report the new traceback immediately.

**Environment Requirements:**
- Access to the local filesystem to read and write files.
- A bash shell to execute commands.

**Task Decomposition:**
1.  **Modify Imports:** In `path_execution_manager.py`, make the following changes:
    - Remove `from biomapper.utils.logging import get_logger`.
    - Remove `from biomapper.utils.time_helpers import get_current_utc_time`.
    - Add `import logging`.
    - In the line `from datetime import datetime`, add `timezone` so it becomes `from datetime import datetime, timezone`.
2.  **Update Logger Instantiation:** In the `PathExecutionManager.__init__` method, find the line `self.logger = logger or get_logger(__name__)` and change it to `self.logger = logger or logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
3.  **Update Timestamp Creation:** In the `PathExecutionManager._default_create_mapping_path_details` method, find the line containing `"execution_timestamp":` and ensure it uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()` for the value. The line should look like: `"execution_timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),`

**Validation Checkpoints:**
1.  After saving, read the file again to confirm all changes are present.
2.  Execute the command `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` from the `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/` directory and verify that the `ModuleNotFoundError` is resolved.

**Source Prompt Reference:**
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-115530-debug-modulenotfound-biomapper-utils.md`

**Context from Previous Attempts:**
- This is the first attempt to fix the `biomapper.utils.logging` import error. A previous, related `ModuleNotFoundError` for `biomapper.types` was successfully resolved, which then revealed this error.
