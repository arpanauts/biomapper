# Task: Create Unit Tests for `PathFinder`

## Objective
To validate the complex logic of path discovery, create a suite of unit tests for the `PathFinder` class. These tests are critical for ensuring the mapping engine can correctly identify routes between different ontologies.

## Location for Tests
Create a new test file: `tests/core/engine_components/test_path_finder.py`

## Test Strategy
Since `PathFinder` interacts heavily with the database, the tests should use a mocked SQLAlchemy session (`unittest.mock.MagicMock`) to simulate database responses. This will allow us to test the pathfinding logic in isolation without requiring a live database.

## Test Cases

1.  **Test Direct Path Found**: Mock the session to return a direct mapping path between a source and target ontology. Assert that `find_path` returns the correct, single-step path.
2.  **Test Indirect Path Found**: Mock the session to return a multi-step path (e.g., A -> B -> C). Assert that `find_path` correctly assembles the two-step path.
3.  **Test No Path Found**: Mock the session to return no available paths. Assert that `find_path` returns `None` or an empty list.
4.  **Test Path Ambiguity**: Mock the session to return multiple potential paths. Assert that the `PathFinder` correctly selects the one with the highest priority.
5.  **Test `_get_path_details` Logic**: Write specific tests that mock the database queries within `_get_path_details` and verify that it correctly constructs the path details dictionary.
6.  **Test Path Caching**: Call `find_path` for the same source/target pair multiple times. Mock the database session to be called only once, and assert that the cached result is returned on subsequent calls.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A new test file `tests/core/engine_components/test_path_finder.py` is created.
*   The tests thoroughly cover the logic in `path_finder.py` using a mocked database session.
*   All tests pass successfully.
