# Prompt: Final Comprehensive Integration Test Run and Status Assessment

**Objective:** Execute the entire Biomapper integration test suite to confirm the success of recent fixes, check for any regressions, and establish a final baseline of test health for this phase of work.

**Context:**
A series of targeted fixes have been applied, culminating in the resolution of 23 previously failing tests as detailed in feedback `2025-06-05-083705-feedback-yaml-async-mock-fixes.md`. These fixes addressed:
1.  Missing/incorrect parameters in YAML strategy configurations.
2.  SQLAlchemy `MissingGreenlet` errors (resolved with eager loading).
3.  Mock configuration issues in historical ID mapping tests.

This comprehensive run will verify that these fixes hold across the entire suite and that no new issues have been inadvertently introduced.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Ensure Clean Test Environment:**
    *   Verify that the development database (e.g., `metamapper.db`) has the necessary migrations applied (especially `05a1cef680a1_...`).
    *   Ensure all project dependencies are up to date: `poetry install`.

2.  **Execute Full Integration Test Suite:**
    *   Run all tests in the `tests/integration` directory.
    *   Use verbose output and capture the full log.
        ```bash
        poetry run pytest tests/integration -v --log-cli-level=INFO > final_full_integration_test_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
        ```
        (Replace `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` with the current timestamp).

3.  **Analyze Test Results:**
    *   Provide a summary: Total tests, Passed, Failed, Errors, Skipped.
    *   **Crucially, compare these results to the previous full run's statistics (from feedback `2025-06-05-075841-feedback-post-migration-test-analysis.md`) to highlight the overall improvement.**
    *   List any remaining failures or errors. For each, provide:
        *   The exact error message.
        *   The test files and specific test cases affected.
        *   A brief hypothesis of the cause if immediately obvious, or note if it requires further investigation.
    *   Confirm that the 23 tests reported as fixed in the latest feedback are indeed still passing.

**Deliverables:**

*   The full log file from the test run (e.g., `final_full_integration_test_run_20250605_084000.log`).
*   A summary of the test results (total, passed, failed, errors, skipped), including a comparison with the previous full run.
*   A detailed breakdown of any remaining failures, including error messages and affected tests.
*   Confirmation that the previously fixed 23 tests are still passing.

**Next Steps (Anticipated):**
*   If all tests pass, the primary objective of stabilizing the integration tests will be largely met. Focus can then shift to the other recommendations from the feedback (documentation, further async review, new tests for eager loading).
*   If new or unexpected failures arise, targeted prompts will be generated to address them.
