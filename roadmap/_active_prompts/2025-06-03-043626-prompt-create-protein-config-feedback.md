# Task: Create Feedback Document for protein_config.yaml Generation

## Context:
The initial version of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` was generated based on a detailed prompt (see Memory `1c239c6a-0dba-40bd-b8ae-01cba32db9c7` in the Cascade agent's context, which references requirements from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-02-224317-focused-strategy-review.md`).

As part of that original task, a feedback file documenting the generation process was required. This task is to create that feedback file.

## Instructions:
1.  **Review the Generated `protein_config.yaml`:**
    *   Examine the current, fully uncommented version of `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.

2.  **Recall or Re-evaluate Assumptions and Decisions:**
    *   Consider the information that was available when defining the configurations for the 6 protein data sources (Arivale, UKBB, HPP, Function Health, SPOKE, KG2).
    *   Think about any assumptions made regarding:
        *   File paths and names (e.g., `${DATA_DIR}/arivale_data/proteomics_metadata.tsv`).
        *   Primary protein identifiers and their corresponding column names.
        *   Secondary/cross-reference identifiers and column names.
        *   Client configurations (key/value columns, delimiters).
        *   The overall YAML schema interpretation.

3.  **Draft the Feedback Document:**
    *   Create a new Markdown file.
    *   The content should address the following points, as requested in the original task:
        *   **Assumptions Made:** Clearly list all significant assumptions made about file paths, column names, identifier types, data formats, etc., for each of the 6 databases.
        *   **Challenges Encountered:** Describe any difficulties faced while interpreting the Biomapper YAML schema or applying it to the diverse data sources.
        *   **Suggestions for Schema Improvements:** If any ideas for improving the YAML schema became apparent during the configuration process, document them.
        *   **Confirmation of Task Completion:** Briefly confirm that the `protein_config.yaml` was generated according to the initial requirements (now fully uncommented and ready for use).

## Expected Output:
*   A Markdown file named `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-generate-protein-config-yaml.md` (use the current UTC timestamp for the filename, matching the format of other feedback files) saved in the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/` directory.

## Feedback Requirements (for this specific prompt):
Create a simple Markdown feedback file named `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-on-creating-protein-config-feedback.md` (use the current UTC timestamp) in the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/` directory.
In this file, please:
1.  Confirm that the main feedback document (`...-feedback-generate-protein-config-yaml.md`) has been created and saved to the correct location.
2.  Provide the full filename of the created main feedback document.
