# Task 1: Refactor Core MappingExecutor Unit Tests

## 1. Objective

Refactor the core unit tests for `MappingExecutor` that are currently failing or skipped due to the recent service-oriented architecture refactoring. The goal is to decouple these tests from the `MappingExecutor`'s internal implementation and instead test the new, focused service classes (`StrategyExecutionService`, `PathFinder`, `ConfigLoader`, etc.) directly or test `MappingExecutor` as a high-level orchestrator using dependency injection.

## 2. Context and Background

The `MappingExecutor` was recently refactored from a large, monolithic class into a lean orchestrator that delegates tasks to specialized service classes. This has broken numerous unit tests that were tightly coupled to its old internal methods (e.g., `_run_path_steps`, `_get_path_from_cache`). This task is to update these tests to reflect the new architecture, ensuring our test suite is robust and maintainable.

## 3. Prerequisites

- The agent must understand the new service-oriented architecture and the roles of classes like `StrategyExecutionService`, `PathFinder`, `IdentifierLoader`, and `ConfigLoader`.

## 4. Task Breakdown

For each of the files below, perform the following steps:

1.  **Analyze Existing Tests:** Identify why each test is failing. Most failures will be due to `AttributeError` for methods that no longer exist.
2.  **Determine the New Target:** Decide what the test *should* be testing in the new architecture. Is it testing logic now in `PathFinder`? Or `StrategyExecutionService`? Or is it a high-level integration test of `MappingExecutor`?
3.  **Rewrite the Test:**
    - If testing a service, write a new test file for that service (if one doesn't exist) or add to an existing one. Use mocking (`unittest.mock`) to isolate the service from its dependencies (e.g., database sessions, other services).
    - If testing `MappingExecutor`'s orchestration logic, mock the service-level dependencies that are passed into its constructor and assert that the correct service methods are called with the expected parameters.
4.  **Delete Old Test:** Once the logic is covered by a new, robust test, delete the old, failing test.

### Target Files:

- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/core/test_mapping_executor_metadata.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor_robust_features.py`
- `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor_utilities.py`

## 5. Implementation Requirements

- **Code Standards:** Follow existing code style, use `pytest` conventions, and leverage `unittest.mock` for mocking. All new tests must be asynchronous (`async def`).
- **Dependency Injection:** Heavily rely on dependency injection to make tests clean and isolated.

## 6. Validation and Success Criteria

- **Success:** All tests in the modified files pass when run with `poetry run pytest [file_path]`.
- **Coverage:** The logical intent of the original tests is preserved in the new tests.
- **No Skipped Tests:** Do not use `pytest.mark.skip`. Either fix the test or delete it if it's no longer relevant.

## 7. Feedback and Reporting

- Provide a list of the old test files that were modified/deleted.
- Provide a list of the new test files that were created/modified.
- Confirm that all tests pass by providing the output of `pytest` for the relevant files.
