# Prompt: Debug Pytest Collection Error After Core Component Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-06-18
**Objective:** Identify and resolve the `pytest` collection error ("collecting 0 items / 1 error") occurring after refactoring core components into the `biomapper/core/engine_components/` subfolder and updating import statements.

## 1. Problem Summary

After moving `action_loader.py`, `action_executor.py`, `strategy_handler.py`, `path_finder.py`, and `reversible_path.py` from `biomapper/core/` to `biomapper/core/engine_components/` and updating all identified import statements in both the main codebase and test files, `pytest` fails to collect any tests.

-   **Command:** `poetry run pytest -vv`
-   **Observed Output:** `collecting 0 items / 1 error` (without a specific traceback in the console).

## 2. Debugging Steps Taken So Far

1.  **Ensured Package Initialization:**
    *   Verified that `biomapper/core/engine_components/__init__.py` exists (it was missing and subsequently created).
2.  **Correct Environment Usage:**
    *   Confirmed commands are run within the Poetry environment using `poetry run pytest`.
3.  **Configuration Review:**
    *   Checked `pytest.ini`: Contains only `filterwarnings`.
    *   Checked `pyproject.toml`: The `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section specifies `testpaths = ["tests"]` and `python_files = ["test_*.py"]`, which is standard and should correctly discover tests.
4.  **Advanced Pytest Flags:**
    *   `poetry run pytest --collect-only -vv`: Still resulted in `collecting 0 items / 1 error`.
    *   `poetry run pytest --debug -vv`: Generated `pytestdebug.log`, but access to this file was restricted by `.gitignore`, preventing direct review through the tool.
5.  **Targeted Test File Execution Attempts:**
    *   Initial attempt to run a non-existent `tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor.py` failed (file not found).
    *   Identified correct test file names in `tests/unit/core/` (e.g., `test_action_loader.py`, `test_mapping_executor_robust_features.py`).
    *   Attempted to run `poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py -vv`. The output was `collecting ...` but appeared to be truncated or did not complete, so the full result or specific error is unknown.

## 3. Next Steps for Investigation

The key is to get a specific error message from `pytest`.

1.  **Re-run Pytest on a Single Test File (Capture Full Output):**
    *   **Action:** Execute the following command in the project root (`/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`):
        ```bash
        poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py -vv
        ```
    *   **Objective:** Carefully capture the *complete and unabbreviated* output. The previous attempt was cut short. This command targets a specific test file whose imports (and the imports of the module it tests) have been updated. If there's an import error or another issue preventing this single file from being collected or run, it should provide a direct traceback.

2.  **Analyze Single Test File Output:**
    *   **If an error/traceback is shown:** This will be the primary clue. Investigate the specific error (e.g., `ImportError`, `SyntaxError` in the test file or the code it imports).
    *   **If it collects and runs tests (or still shows "collecting 0 items"):** This would be very unusual for a single, valid test file path and might point to a deeper, more subtle configuration issue or a problem in a `conftest.py` file.

3.  **Investigate `conftest.py` Files:**
    *   **Action:** Review any `conftest.py` files in the `tests/` directory or its subdirectories. Errors in `conftest.py` files can prevent test collection globally.
    *   **Objective:** Look for import errors or other issues within these files.

4.  **Systematic Import Verification (If Necessary):**
    *   **Action:** If a specific test file (like `test_action_loader.py`) still fails to collect without a clear error, manually review all import statements in:
        *   `tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py`
        *   `biomapper/core/engine_components/action_loader.py` (the module it tests)
        *   Any modules imported by `action_loader.py`.
    *   **Objective:** Double-check for any missed path updates, typos, or potential circular dependencies.

## 4. Expected Outcome

A clear error message from `pytest` that pinpoints the cause of the collection failure, allowing for a targeted fix.

## 5. Feedback

Please provide the full output of the command in step 3.1, and any findings from subsequent steps.
