# Task: Generate Unit Tests for `RobustExecutionCoordinator`

## Objective
To ensure the `RobustExecutionCoordinator` correctly manages the robust lifecycle of strategy execution, including interaction with `StrategyOrchestrator`, `CheckpointManager`, and `ProgressReporter`.

## Component to Test
`biomapper.core.engine_components.robust_execution_coordinator.RobustExecutionCoordinator`
(Assuming this path after refactoring)

## Test File Target
`tests/core/engine_components/test_robust_execution_coordinator.py`

## Key Functionalities to Test
*   Generation of execution IDs if not provided.
*   Loading checkpoints via `CheckpointManager` if `resume_from_checkpoint` is true.
*   Delegation of strategy execution to `StrategyOrchestrator`.
*   Saving/clearing checkpoints via `CheckpointManager` based on execution outcome.
*   Reporting execution status (start, progress, failure, success) via `ProgressReporter`.
*   Handling of exceptions during strategy orchestration.
*   Correct propagation of results and errors.
*   Retry logic (if implemented within this coordinator).

## Mocking Strategy
*   Mock `StrategyOrchestrator` (especially its main execution method, e.g., `execute_strategy`).
*   Mock `CheckpointManager` (`load_checkpoint`, `save_checkpoint`, `clear_checkpoint`, `current_checkpoint_file` property).
*   Mock `ProgressReporter` (`report` method).
*   Mock any configuration objects passed (e.g., for retry settings).
*   Use `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` for asynchronous methods.

## Test Cases

1.  **`__init__`:**
    *   Test that `RobustExecutionCoordinator` initializes correctly with its dependencies (`StrategyOrchestrator`, `CheckpointManager`, `ProgressReporter`, etc.).

2.  **`execute_strategy_robustly` (or equivalent method):**
    *   **Successful Execution (No Checkpoint):**
        *   Test with `resume_from_checkpoint=False`.
        *   Verify `CheckpointManager.load_checkpoint` is NOT called (or called and returns `None`).
        *   Verify `StrategyOrchestrator.execute_strategy` is called with correct arguments.
        *   Verify `ProgressReporter.report` is called for start and success events.
        *   Verify `CheckpointManager.clear_checkpoint` is called on success.
        *   Verify the result from `StrategyOrchestrator` is returned, possibly augmented with robustness metadata.
    *   **Successful Execution (Resuming from Checkpoint):**
        *   Test with `resume_from_checkpoint=True` and `CheckpointManager.load_checkpoint` returns a valid state.
        *   Verify `StrategyOrchestrator.execute_strategy` is called, potentially with state from checkpoint.
        *   Verify `ProgressReporter.report` includes information about checkpoint usage.
        *   Verify `CheckpointManager.clear_checkpoint` on success.
    *   **Execution Failure (No Checkpoint to Save):**
        *   Test when `StrategyOrchestrator.execute_strategy` raises an exception.
        *   Verify `ProgressReporter.report` is called for failure event, indicating no checkpoint was saved (if applicable based on `CheckpointManager`'s behavior).
        *   Verify `CheckpointManager.save_checkpoint` is called (or not, depending on design if failure is too early).
        *   Verify the exception is re-raised or handled as a `MappingExecutionError`.
    *   **Execution Failure (Checkpoint Saved):**
        *   Test when `StrategyOrchestrator.execute_strategy` raises an exception after some progress.
        *   Verify `CheckpointManager.save_checkpoint` is called with the current state.
        *   Verify `ProgressReporter.report` indicates failure and checkpoint availability.
    *   **Execution ID Handling:**
        *   Test that an execution ID is generated if not provided.
        *   Test that a provided execution ID is used.
    *   **Retry Logic (if applicable):**
        *   Test successful execution after a few retries.
        *   Test permanent failure after max retries.

3.  **Interaction with Dependencies:**
    *   Ensure all mocked dependencies (`StrategyOrchestrator`, `CheckpointManager`, `ProgressReporter`) are called with the expected arguments and in the correct order for various scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   All specified test cases pass.
*   Tests cover successful executions (with/without checkpoint), failure scenarios (with/without checkpoint saving), and correct interaction with all dependencies.
*   Mocks are used effectively to isolate `RobustExecutionCoordinator`.
*   Correct error propagation and reporting are verified.
