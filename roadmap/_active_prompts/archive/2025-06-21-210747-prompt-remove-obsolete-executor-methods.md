# Task: Finalize MappingExecutor Refactoring by Removing Obsolete Methods

**Source Prompt Reference:** This task is defined by the prompt: `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-21-210747-prompt-remove-obsolete-executor-methods.md`

## 1. Task Objective
The primary objective is to complete the modular refactoring of `biomapper.core.mapping_executor.MappingExecutor` by identifying and removing all private methods that have become obsolete after their logic was delegated to dedicated service classes. The goal is to significantly reduce the line count and complexity of `mapping_executor.py`, solidifying its new role as a lean orchestrator.

## 2. Prerequisites
- [X] Required files exist:
  - `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
  - `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/services/` (and all service files within)
- [X] Required permissions: Write access to the `biomapper` directory.
- [X] Required dependencies: All project dependencies are installed via Poetry.
- [X] Environment state: The `main` branch is up-to-date, and the recent refactoring of `MappingExecutor` to use service classes is present.

## 3. Context from Previous Attempts (if applicable)
This is not a retry. This is the planned final step of a successful, multi-stage refactoring effort. The previous steps involved creating service classes and delegating logic from `MappingExecutor` to them. This task is the final cleanup phase.

## 4. Task Decomposition
Break this task into the following verifiable subtasks:
1.  **Analyze `MappingExecutor`:** Carefully read through `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`. Identify all private methods (e.g., `_execute_mapping_step`, `_find_best_path`, etc.) whose core logic is now handled by a service class (e.g., `MappingStepExecutionService`, `PathFinder`, `BidirectionalValidationService`).
2.  **Verify Obsolescence:** For each candidate method identified in step 1, confirm that it is no longer called by any other method within the `MappingExecutor` class. The only remaining calls should be the public methods that now delegate to the services.
3.  **Remove Obsolete Methods:** Delete the identified and verified obsolete private methods from the `MappingExecutor` class.
4.  **Run Tests:** Execute the full test suite using `pytest` to ensure that the removal of these methods has not introduced any regressions or broken existing functionality.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
- **Input files/data:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
- **Expected outputs:** An updated, leaner version of `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` with the obsolete methods removed.
- **Code standards:** Maintain existing code style, formatting, and type hints.
- **Validation requirements:** The primary validation is the successful execution of the `pytest` suite.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
- **Permission/Tool Errors:** Escalate to the USER if you lack permissions to edit files or run commands.
- **Dependency Errors:** Run `poetry install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- **Logic/Implementation Errors:** If removing a method causes test failures, it indicates the method was not truly obsolete. In this case, do not proceed with the removal of that specific method. Document which method could not be removed and why in your feedback. Classify the error as `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` and recommend further analysis.

## 7. Success Criteria and Validation
Task is complete when:
- [ ] At least 5-10 private, now-obsolete methods have been removed from `MappingExecutor`.
- [ ] The total line count of `mapping_executor.py` has been significantly reduced.
- [ ] All tests in the project's test suite pass successfully after the changes (`pytest`).

## 8. Feedback Requirements
Create a detailed Markdown feedback file at:
`/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-remove-obsolete-executor-methods.md`

**Mandatory Feedback Sections:**
- **Execution Status:** [COMPLETE_SUCCESS | PARTIAL_SUCCESS | FAILED_NEEDS_ESCALATION]
- **Completed Subtasks:** [Checklist of what was accomplished]
- **Summary of Changes:** List the specific methods that were removed from `MappingExecutor`.
- **Issues Encountered:** Detail any methods that were candidates for removal but could not be removed due to test failures or other dependencies.
- **Next Action Recommendation:** Propose the next logical step, which may be to commit the changes or investigate any remaining complex methods.
