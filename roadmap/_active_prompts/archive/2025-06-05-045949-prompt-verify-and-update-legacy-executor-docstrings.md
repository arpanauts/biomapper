# Prompt: Verify and Update Docstrings for Legacy MappingExecutor Methods

**Date:** 2025-06-05
**Version:** 1.0
**Project:** Biomapper - YAML Strategy Execution Enhancement
**Goal:** Verify the presence and accurately document the legacy `MappingExecutor.execute_strategy` method and its associated handler methods (`_handle_convert_identifiers_local`, `_handle_execute_mapping_path`, `_handle_filter_identifiers_by_target_presence`) if they were preserved during the recent cleanup.

## 1. Background

Recent feedback from the `MappingExecutor` cleanup (`2025-06-05-043053-feedback-cleanup-mapping-executor.md`) indicated that the legacy `execute_strategy` method and its direct handlers were *preserved* for backward compatibility and active use, contrary to the initial cleanup prompt's suggestion to remove them.

However, the subsequent docstring update feedback (`2025-06-05-043053-feedback-update-mapping-executor-docstrings.md`) implies these might have been removed. This discrepancy needs resolution.

This prompt focuses on ensuring that if these legacy methods are indeed still present in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`, their docstrings are accurate, comprehensive, and clearly explain their role, current implementation status (e.g., if handlers are placeholders), and relationship to the newer YAML-based strategy execution.

## 2. Task Description

### 2.1. Verify Presence of Legacy Methods

1.  **Inspect `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`**.
2.  Confirm whether the following methods still exist:
    *   `async def execute_strategy(...)` (the older version, not `execute_yaml_strategy`)
    *   `async def _handle_convert_identifiers_local(...)`
    *   `async def _handle_execute_mapping_path(...)`
    *   `async def _handle_filter_identifiers_by_target_presence(...)`

### 2.2. Update Docstrings (If Methods Exist)

If the above methods are present, review and update their docstrings to meet the following criteria:

For `execute_strategy`:
- **Purpose:** Clearly state that this is a legacy method for executing older, non-YAML based strategies.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Emphasize its role in maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Relationship to Handlers:** Explain how it calls the `_handle_...` methods.
- **Parameters:** Ensure all parameters are accurately documented (name, type, description).
- **Return Value:** Document the return type and structure accurately.
- **Exceptions:** List any exceptions it might raise.
- **Usage Notes:** Briefly mention if/when it should be used compared to `execute_yaml_strategy`.

For `_handle_...` methods (e.g., `_handle_convert_identifiers_local`):
- **Purpose:** Describe the specific task each handler is responsible for within the context of the legacy `execute_strategy`.
- **Current Status:** If these handlers are currently placeholders (as suggested by some feedback), the docstring should clearly state this. For example: "Note: This handler is currently a placeholder and its logic may be further developed or integrated with newer strategy actions."
- **Parameters, Return Value, Exceptions:** Ensure these are accurately documented.
- **Relationship to `execute_strategy`:** Clarify that they are called by the legacy `execute_strategy`.

### 2.3. General Docstring Standards
- Use a consistent docstring format (e.g., reStructuredText or Google style, aligning with the project's existing dominant style).
- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.
- Correct any outdated information or references.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- The presence or absence of the specified legacy methods in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` is confirmed.
- If present, the docstrings for `execute_strategy` and its associated `_handle_...` methods are updated to be accurate, comprehensive, and clearly define their role and current status.
- If the methods are indeed placeholders, this is explicitly stated in their docstrings.
- The updated docstrings align with the project's coding and documentation standards.
- Any confusion arising from conflicting feedback regarding these methods is resolved by this update.

## 4. Deliverables

- Confirmation of whether the legacy methods exist.
- If they exist, a diff or description of the changes made to their docstrings in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`.
- A statement clarifying the final status and documentation of these methods.

## 5. Notes

- The feedback from `2025-06-05-043053-feedback-cleanup-mapping-executor.md` should be considered the primary source of truth regarding which methods were *actually* preserved during the cleanup, as it details the rationale.
- This task is crucial for code maintainability and ensuring that developers understand the purpose and current state of all parts of the `MappingExecutor`.
