# Prompt: Review and Update `MappingExecutor` Docstrings

**Date:** 2025-06-05
**Project:** Biomapper
**Objective:** Review and update all relevant docstrings within `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` to ensure they are accurate, comprehensive, and reflect the current state of the code after the critical cleanup of duplicate and obsolete methods.

## Background

Feedback from the YAML strategy documentation update (`2025-06-05-042727-feedback-yaml-strategy-documentation-update.md`) indicated that `MappingExecutor` docstrings were good but might refer to placeholder handlers. A critical code cleanup task (`2025-06-05-043053-prompt-cleanup-mapping-executor.md`) will consolidate and remove methods. This task is to align all docstrings with the refactored code.

**Prerequisite:** This task should ideally be performed *after* the `MappingExecutor` cleanup task is completed.

## Tasks

1.  **Review Docstring for Consolidated `execute_yaml_strategy` Method:**
    *   Ensure the docstring accurately describes the method's parameters, functionality, and return value (`MappingResultBundle`).
    *   Verify that explanations of the execution flow, handling of `is_required` flag, and the structure of `MappingResultBundle` are correct and clear.
    *   Update any examples to reflect the current method signature and typical usage.
    *   Confirm that any mentioned exceptions are still relevant and correctly documented.

2.  **Review Docstring for Consolidated `_execute_strategy_action` Method:**
    *   Ensure this internal method's docstring clearly explains its role in dispatching to the specific strategy action classes (`ConvertIdentifiersLocalAction`, `ExecuteMappingPathAction`, `FilterByTargetPresenceAction`).
    *   Clarify that it no longer uses placeholder logic but instantiates and calls these dedicated action classes.
    *   Describe the `action_context` object passed to the action classes, if not already clear.

3.  **Review Docstrings of Other Public and Key Internal Methods:**
    *   Check other public methods of `MappingExecutor` for accuracy and completeness.
    *   Review important internal methods (e.g., `_execute_path`, `_get_mapping_path_by_name_async`) to ensure their docstrings are up-to-date with any changes resulting from the cleanup or new action handler integration.

4.  **Remove or Update Docstrings for Obsolete/Removed Code:**
    *   If any docstrings remain for methods that were removed during cleanup (e.g., old `execute_strategy`, old `_handle_...` methods), ensure these docstrings are also removed.
    *   If methods were merged, ensure the consolidated method's docstring captures all relevant information.

5.  **Check for Consistency and Clarity:**
    *   Ensure consistent terminology and formatting across all docstrings in the file.
    *   Improve clarity and readability where possible.
    *   Verify that parameter names and types in docstrings match the method signatures.

## Files to Modify

*   `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

*   All public method docstrings in `MappingExecutor` are accurate and reflect the current code.
*   Docstrings for key internal methods, especially `_execute_strategy_action`, are updated and correct.
*   Docstrings clearly state that strategy execution uses dedicated action classes, not placeholder logic.
*   No docstrings remain for methods that have been removed.
*   Examples in docstrings are functional and use current APIs.
*   The overall quality and accuracy of documentation within `mapping_executor.py` are improved.

## Notes

*   This task is highly dependent on the outcome of the `MappingExecutor` cleanup. Ensure you are working with the cleaned-up version of the file.
*   Pay attention to how `MappingResultBundle`, `ActionResult`, and `ActionContext` are described and used, ensuring consistency with their actual implementations.
