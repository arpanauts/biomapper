# Prompt: Add Unit Tests for MappingExecutor Robust Features

**Objective:**

Create comprehensive unit tests for the `MappingExecutor` class, specifically focusing on the robust execution features that were integrated from the (now deprecated) `MappingExecutorRobust` and `MappingExecutorEnhanced` classes. These features include checkpointing, retry mechanisms, batch processing, and progress callback handling.

**Background:**

The `MappingExecutor` was recently simplified by merging functionality from `MappingExecutorRobust` and `MappingExecutorEnhanced`. While basic testing and backward compatibility checks were performed, a dedicated suite of unit tests for these specific robust features needs to be established to ensure their continued correctness and stability.

**Key File to Test:**

*   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`

**Key Features to Test:**

1.  **Checkpointing:**
    *   Verify that mapping progress is correctly saved to a checkpoint file at specified intervals or conditions.
    *   Test resumption from a checkpoint: ensure the executor correctly loads state and continues from where it left off.
    *   Test scenarios with invalid or corrupted checkpoint files.
    *   Verify correct handling of `checkpoint_dir` and `checkpoint_filename` parameters.

2.  **Retry Mechanisms:**
    *   Simulate transient errors during action execution (e.g., mock an action to raise an exception a few times before succeeding).
    *   Verify that the executor retries failed actions according to the configured `max_retries` and `retry_delay`.
    *   Test different retry strategies if applicable (e.g., exponential backoff, though current implementation might be fixed delay).
    *   Ensure that if retries are exhausted, the appropriate error is propagated or handled.

3.  **Batch Processing:**
    *   Test the `batch_size` parameter: ensure identifiers are processed in batches as expected.
    *   Verify that results from multiple batches are correctly aggregated.
    *   Test edge cases: batch size larger than total items, batch size of 1, empty input list.

4.  **Progress Callbacks:**
    *   Implement a mock progress callback function.
    *   Verify that the callback is invoked at appropriate times during the execution (e.g., after each batch, on progress updates).
    *   Ensure the callback receives correct information (e.g., processed count, total count, current step).

**Tasks:**

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with `MappingExecutor`:**
    *   Review the current implementation of `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`, paying close attention to how checkpointing, retries, batching, and progress updates are handled.

2.  **Set Up Test Environment:**
    *   Create a new test file, for example, `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/test_mapping_executor_robust_features.py`.
    *   Use `unittest` or `pytest` as the testing framework (follow existing conventions in the `tests` directory).
    *   Ensure you can mock strategy actions, configuration, and external dependencies (like file system operations for checkpointing) as needed.

3.  **Write Unit Tests for Each Feature Area:**
    *   **Checkpointing:** Create test cases covering saving, loading, and various scenarios mentioned above. Use temporary directories for checkpoint files.
    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Design tests that involve mocking actions to fail and then succeed. Verify retry counts and delays.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Test with various input sizes and batch sizes. Check the flow of identifiers through batched execution.
    *   **Progress Callbacks:** Test that a provided callback function is called with the correct arguments at the correct times.

4.  **Ensure Test Isolation and Independence:**
    *   Each test case should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
    *   Clean up any created artifacts (like temporary checkpoint files) after each test or test suite.

5.  **Follow Best Practices:**
    *   Use descriptive test method names.
    *   Include assertions that clearly verify the expected outcomes.
    *   Aim for good code coverage of the relevant sections in `MappingExecutor`.

**Deliverable:**

A new Python test file (e.g., `test_mapping_executor_robust_features.py`) containing the unit tests for the specified `MappingExecutor` features. The tests should be runnable and pass within the project's existing testing environment.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Focus on unit testing the logic within `MappingExecutor` itself. Mock interactions with `StrategyAction` execute methods where necessary to control their behavior (e.g., to simulate errors for retry tests or to check inputs for batching tests).
*   Refer to existing unit tests in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/tests/unit/core/` for style and structure conventions.
