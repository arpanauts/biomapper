# Task: Refactor MappingExecutor - Extract Path Discovery and Caching Logic

## 1. Context and Background
The `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` file, despite recent refactoring of its YAML strategy execution components, remains very large (over 5000 lines). This is the next phase in a series of refactorings aimed at making `MappingExecutor` more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

This task focuses on extracting the logic responsible for discovering, selecting, and potentially caching mapping paths between different ontology types or endpoints. This logic is currently intertwined within `MappingExecutor`.

## 2. Task Objective
1.  **Refactor:** Identify and extract the components within `mapping_executor.py` responsible for:
    *   Finding available mapping paths (e.g., shortest paths, all paths) between specified source and target ontology types or endpoints. This likely includes methods like `_find_shortest_paths_for_mapping`, `_get_all_paths_for_source`, `_get_paths_between_endpoints`, and related helper functions.
    *   Managing any caching mechanisms specifically related to these discovered mapping paths (if distinct from general results caching).
    *   Handling `ReversiblePath` logic if it's tightly coupled with path discovery.
    Move this logic into one or more new, well-defined Python modules/classes within the `biomapper.core` package (e.g., `biomapper.core.path_finder.py`, `biomapper.core.path_cache.py`, or similar).
2.  **Integrate:** Update the main `mapping_executor.py` to utilize these new refactored components for all path discovery needs.

## 3. Scope of Work
- **Analysis:**
    - Thoroughly analyze `mapping_executor.py` to pinpoint all code related to mapping path discovery, selection algorithms (e.g., shortest path), interaction with database models like `MappingPath`, `MappingPathStep`, `OntologyPreference`, and any path-specific caching.
    - Analyze the usage and role of the `ReversiblePath` class.
- **Design New Module(s):**
    - Propose a clean structure for the new module(s) (e.g., a `PathFinderService` class).
    - Define clear interfaces between the main `MappingExecutor` and these new components. The `MappingExecutor` will likely need to request paths from this new service, providing source/target criteria.
- **Implementation:**
    - Create the new Python file(s) in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/`.
    - Carefully move the identified logic from `mapping_executor.py` to the new module(s).
    - Ensure the new module(s) have access to necessary configurations and database sessions, passed appropriately from `MappingExecutor` or initialized within the new module if it makes sense.
    - Modify `mapping_executor.py` to delegate all path discovery and selection responsibilities to the new module(s).
- **Testing:**
    - Ensure all existing unit tests for `MappingExecutor` that rely on path discovery continue to pass after the refactoring. Update them as necessary to reflect the new structure (they might need to mock the new pathfinding service).
    - Write new unit tests specifically for the extracted module(s) to ensure their pathfinding and caching logic is thoroughly tested in isolation.

## 4. Deliverables
- The modified (and now smaller in the relevant sections) `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`.
- New Python file(s) for the refactored path discovery and caching logic.
- Updated and new unit tests.
- A feedback file detailing the changes, design decisions, and test results.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
- Adhere to Python best practices (PEP 8, clear naming, good documentation/comments).
- The new pathfinding module(s) should be self-contained as much as possible, with clear dependencies.
- Maintain existing pathfinding functionality and performance characteristics unless specific improvements are part of the design.
- Changes should be well-encapsulated.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
- Work iteratively. Commit changes frequently.
- If major issues arise, be prepared to revert to a stable state and re-evaluate the approach for the problematic section.
- Ensure comprehensive logging within the new components to aid debugging.

## 7. Feedback Requirements
