# Task: Resolve Miscellaneous Test Errors

## Objective
Address a diverse collection of remaining test failures across various parts of the Biomapper application, including examples/tutorials, embedder components, MVP pipeline tests, Spoke integration, and other core utilities like ActionLoader and PathFinder.

## Affected Files/Modules
- `examples/tutorials/test_gemini.py`
- `tests/embedder/storage/test_vector_store.py`
- `tests/embedder/test_qdrant_store.py`
- `tests/mapping/test_endpoint_mapping.py`
- `tests/mvp0_pipeline/test_pipeline_orchestrator.py`
- `tests/mvp0_pipeline/test_qdrant_search.py`
- `tests/spoke/test_graph_analyzer.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py`
- `tests/unit/core/test_path_finder.py`
- `tests/mapping/rag/test_rag_setup.py`

## Common Error(s)
This category is a mix of various error types, including but not limited to:
- `requests.exceptions.MissingSchema`: Invalid URL format.
- `AssertionError`: General test expectation failures.
- `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class ...`: Attempting to instantiate an abstract base class that has unimplemented abstract methods.
- `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`: Database connectivity issue.
- `AttributeError`: Missing attributes or methods, often due to refactoring or incorrect object state.
- `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError`: Pydantic model validation failures.
- `SQLAlchemyError`: Generic database errors during test execution.
- `biomapper.core.exceptions.ConfigurationError`: Errors related to loading or instantiating configured components (e.g., Actions).

## Background/Context
This prompt serves as a catch-all for errors that don't fit neatly into the previously defined categories. They span different layers and functionalities of the application, from example usage and embedding/vector store interactions to specific data source integrations (Spoke) and core framework components (ActionLoader, PathFinder).

Each error will likely require a focused investigation into the specific component and test case.

## Debugging Guidance/Hypotheses

- **`requests.exceptions.MissingSchema` (`test_gemini.py`):**
    - An URL is being used (likely for an API call) that is missing the scheme (e.g., `http://` or `https://`). Check configuration values or how URLs are constructed for the Gemini API client.

- **`TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class QdrantVectorStore` (`test_qdrant_store.py`):**
    - `QdrantVectorStore` is likely an abstract base class. Tests should instantiate a concrete implementation, or if testing the ABC directly, ensure all abstract methods are mocked/implemented if instantiation is attempted.

- **`sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` (`test_endpoint_mapping.py`):**
    - The test is trying to connect to a SQLite database file, but the file cannot be opened. Check the database path, file permissions, or if the database file is expected to exist/be created by the test setup.

- **`AttributeError` in `test_pipeline_orchestrator.py`, `test_qdrant_search.py`, `test_graph_analyzer.py`, `test_action_loader.py`:**
    - These are likely due to refactoring where method/attribute names changed, or objects are not in the expected state (e.g., `NoneType` errors like in `test_graph_analyzer.py`). Review recent changes to these components and update tests accordingly.
    - For `test_action_loader.py` errors like `property 'action_registry' of 'ActionLoader' object has no deleter` or `AttributeError: <module ...>`, this points to issues with how actions are registered, loaded, or mocked, possibly related to recent refactoring of action loading or registry mechanisms.

- **`pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError` (`test_qdrant_search.py`):**
    - Data being passed to a Pydantic model for validation (e.g., `MappingOutput`) does not conform to the model's schema. Inspect the data being validated and the Pydantic model definition.

- **`SQLAlchemyError` (`test_path_finder.py`):**
    - A generic database error occurred. This could be due to incorrect query formation, issues with the test database session, or problems with the underlying data or schema expected by the PathFinder.

- **`AssertionError` (general):**
    - These require case-by-case analysis. Check what the test is asserting and why it's failing. It could be outdated test logic, incorrect mocks, or a bug in the component.

- **`ConfigurationError` (`test_action_loader.py`):**
    - Errors like `Failed to instantiate action ... takes no arguments` or `Unexpected error loading action class` indicate problems with the configuration provided for an action or the action class itself (e.g., `__init__` signature mismatch, module/class not found).

## Specific Error Examples
1.  `FAILED examples/tutorials/test_gemini.py::test_gemini_api - requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL 'None': No scheme supplied. Perhaps you meant https://None?`
2.  `ERROR tests/embedder/test_qdrant_store.py::TestQdrantVectorStoreScores::test_search_returns_similarity_scores - TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class QdrantVectorStore with abstract methods add_documents, clear, get_similar`
3.  `FAILED tests/mapping/test_endpoint_mapping.py::test_relationship_mapping - sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`
4.  `FAILED tests/mvp0_pipeline/test_qdrant_search.py::TestQdrantSearch::test_search_successful_with_scores - pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for MappingOutput`
5.  `FAILED tests/spoke/test_graph_analyzer.py::test_discover_node_types_spoke_style - AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'collections'`
6.  `FAILED tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py::TestActionLoader::test_instantiate_action - biomapper.core.exceptions.ConfigurationError: [CONFIGURATION_ERROR] Failed to instantiate action 'TEST_ACTION': MockAction() takes no ar...`

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests listed in the 'Affected Files/Modules' for this miscellaneous category pass successfully.
- Configuration issues (URLs, Pydantic models) are resolved.
- Abstract class instantiation errors are fixed by using concrete implementations or appropriate test strategies.
- Database connectivity and operational errors are addressed.
- AttributeErrors and other specific component failures are resolved through targeted debugging and test/code updates.
