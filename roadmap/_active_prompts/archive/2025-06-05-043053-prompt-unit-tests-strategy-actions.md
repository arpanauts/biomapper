# Prompt: Implement Unit Tests for Strategy Action Classes

**Date:** 2025-06-05
**Project:** Biomapper
**Objective:** Develop comprehensive unit tests for the `ConvertIdentifiersLocalAction`, `ExecuteMappingPathAction`, and `FilterByTargetPresenceAction` classes to ensure their individual correctness, robustness, and proper handling of various scenarios and inputs.

## Background

The core action handlers for YAML-defined strategies have been implemented as separate classes within `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/`. As per feedback (`2025-06-05-042725-feedback-core-action-handlers-implementation.md`), unit tests are now needed for these classes to ensure their reliability and to facilitate future refactoring.

## General Guidelines for Unit Tests

*   Tests should be placed in the `tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/` directory.
*   Use `pytest` as the testing framework.
*   Employ mocking (`unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest-mock`) extensively to isolate the class under test from its dependencies (e.g., database interactions, file system access, other action classes, `MappingExecutor` methods).
*   Test for successful execution paths, edge cases, and error handling.
*   Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on external state or the results of other tests.

## Tasks

### 1. Unit Tests for `ConvertIdentifiersLocalAction`
   **File:** `tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/test_convert_identifiers_local.py`
   *   **Test Scenarios:**
        *   Successful conversion with a valid configuration and mock endpoint data (CSVAdapter).
        *   Handling of missing or incomplete `EndpointPropertyConfig` for input/output ontology types.
        *   Correct processing of one-to-many mappings from the mock endpoint data.
        *   Behavior with an empty list of input identifiers.
        *   Behavior when the mock endpoint data file is empty or malformed (if `CSVAdapter` doesn't handle this, test the action's reaction).
        *   Correct statistics in the `ActionResult` (converted, unmapped, total output).
        *   Graceful handling of unmapped identifiers (they should be reported, not cause errors).
   *   **Mocks:** `biomapper.core.adapters.CSVAdapter`, `biomapper.models.endpoint.EndpointPropertyConfig`, database sessions if directly used (prefer mocking data passed to constructor or `execute`).

### 2. Unit Tests for `ExecuteMappingPathAction`
   **File:** `tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/test_execute_mapping_path.py`
   *   **Test Scenarios:**
        *   Successful execution with a valid mapping path name (mock `MappingExecutor._get_mapping_path_by_name_async` and `MappingExecutor._execute_path`).
        *   Handling of a non-existent mapping path name (error expected).
        *   Correct propagation of errors if `_execute_path` (mocked) raises an exception.
        *   Preservation and correct formatting of provenance information from a mock `MappingResultBundle`.
        *   Accurate mapping statistics in the `ActionResult`.
        *   Correct passing of `cache_settings` and `min_confidence` to mocked `_execute_path`.
   *   **Mocks:** `biomapper.core.mapping_executor.MappingExecutor` (specifically methods like `_get_mapping_path_by_name_async`, `_execute_path`), `biomapper.models.mapping_path.MappingPath`, `biomapper.core.models.MappingResultBundle`.

### 3. Unit Tests for `FilterByTargetPresenceAction`
   **File:** `tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/test_filter_by_target_presence.py`
   *   **Test Scenarios:**
        *   Basic filtering without identifier conversion (mock `CSVAdapter` for target data).
        *   Filtering when `conversion_path_to_match_ontology` is provided:
            *   Mock the nested call to `ExecuteMappingPathAction` (or `MappingExecutor._execute_path` if it calls that directly).
            *   Test correct mapping between original and converted identifiers for filtering.
        *   Behavior with an empty target endpoint (mock `CSVAdapter` returning no data).
        *   Scenario where all input identifiers are filtered out.
        *   Scenario where no input identifiers are filtered out.
        *   Correct tracking of passed and failed identifiers in provenance in `ActionResult`.
        *   Handling of `target_identifier_column` and `target_ontology_type` parameters.
   *   **Mocks:** `biomapper.core.adapters.CSVAdapter`, `biomapper.core.strategy_actions.ExecuteMappingPathAction` (or its underlying `MappingExecutor` calls), `biomapper.models.endpoint.EndpointPropertyConfig`.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   New unit test files are created as specified.
*   Each action class has a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering the listed scenarios and others deemed necessary.
*   Tests effectively use mocking to isolate the class under test.
*   All unit tests pass successfully (`pytest tests/unit/core/strategy_actions/`).
*   Test coverage for these new classes is significantly increased.

## Notes

*   Refer to the implementation of each action class to understand its dependencies and logic flows for thorough test case design.
*   Ensure that the `ActionContext` object, if used by the actions, is properly mocked or constructed for tests.
