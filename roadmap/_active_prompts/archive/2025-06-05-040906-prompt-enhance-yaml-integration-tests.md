# Prompt: Enhance YAML Strategy Integration Tests for `is_required` and Edge Cases

**Objective:**
Strengthen the integration test suite for YAML-defined mapping strategies by adding specific test cases for the `is_required` field (optional steps) and other potential edge cases. This ensures comprehensive validation of the `MappingExecutor`'s behavior.

**Context:**
The `is_required` boolean field has been added to the `MappingStrategyStep` model, allowing strategy steps to be marked as optional. The `MappingExecutor` has been updated to respect this flag: failing optional steps should be logged but allow the strategy to continue, while failing required steps should halt execution. The primary integration test file is `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`. A separate script, `scripts/test_optional_steps.py`, was created for initial testing of this feature. This task involves consolidating and expanding these tests within the main integration suite.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Add Tests for `is_required=False` (Optional Steps):**
    *   **File:** `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Create new test strategies in `tests/integration/data/test_protein_strategy_config.yaml` (or a new test YAML config file if preferred for clarity) that include steps with `is_required: false`.
        *   Design these strategies such that an optional step is expected to fail (e.g., by referencing a non-existent resource or using invalid parameters for that step).
        *   Write test cases in `TestYAMLStrategyExecution` that execute these strategies.
        *   **Verify:**
            *   The strategy execution completes without raising an unhandled exception (i.e., it doesn't halt due to the optional step's failure).
            *   The `MappingResultBundle` correctly logs the failure of the optional step (e.g., in `step_results`, the specific step should indicate failure, and `success` should be `false`).
            *   Subsequent steps in the strategy (if any) are executed.
            *   The overall strategy result reflects that an optional step failed but the process continued.

2.  **Add Tests for `is_required=True` (Required Steps Failing):**
    *   **File:** `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Ensure existing tests (like `test_step_failure_handling`) or new tests adequately cover scenarios where a required step (implicitly `is_required: true` or explicitly set) fails.
        *   **Verify:**
            *   Strategy execution halts.
            *   An appropriate exception (e.g., `MappingExecutionError`) is raised and caught by `pytest.raises`.
            *   The `MappingResultBundle` (if accessible or partially built before the hard fail) reflects the point of failure.

3.  **Consolidate `test_optional_steps.py` Logic (Optional):**
    *   Review `scripts/test_optional_steps.py`.
    *   If any unique scenarios or valuable assertions from this script are not covered by the new tests in `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`, migrate them. The goal is to have `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` as the primary, comprehensive suite for YAML strategy testing.

4.  **Test Edge Cases for `is_required`:**
    *   Consider strategies where the *first* step is optional and fails.
    *   Consider strategies where the *last* step is optional and fails.
    *   Consider strategies with multiple sequential optional steps failing.

5.  **Review and Enhance Existing Tests for Robustness:**
    *   Examine current tests for any gaps in coverage related to action parameters, different data inputs, or error conditions not yet explicitly tested.
    *   For example, ensure tests cover various valid and invalid `action_parameters` for each action type.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   New test cases are added to `TestYAMLStrategyExecution` in `test_yaml_strategy_execution.py` that specifically validate the behavior of optional (`is_required=False`) and required (`is_required=True`) steps.
*   Tests confirm that failing optional steps allow strategy continuation and are logged correctly.
*   Tests confirm that failing required steps halt strategy execution and raise appropriate errors.
*   The test suite remains stable and all tests pass after implementing the new action handlers (covered in a separate prompt).
*   Test coverage for YAML strategy execution, particularly concerning step optionality and failure modes, is improved.

**Relevant Files:**
*   `tests/integration/test_yaml_strategy_execution.py`
*   `tests/integration/data/test_protein_strategy_config.yaml` (or new test YAML files)
*   `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` (for understanding behavior to test)
*   `biomapper/db/models.py` (for `MappingStrategyStep.is_required`)
*   `scripts/test_optional_steps.py` (for reference and potential migration)

**Notes/Considerations:**
*   Ensure test YAML configurations are clear and well-commented to explain the purpose of each strategy.
*   Make assertions on the content of the `MappingResultBundle` to verify step-level outcomes and logging.
*   This task can be performed in parallel with or after the implementation of the actual action handlers, but the tests will only fully pass once the handlers are functional.
