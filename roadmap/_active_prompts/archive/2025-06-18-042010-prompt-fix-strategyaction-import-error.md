# Task: Resolve StrategyAction ImportError in Biomapper

## 1. Context and Background
During testing after a database path unification fix (see feedback file `2025-06-18-040934-feedback-fix-db-path-discrepancy.md`), a new `ImportError` was identified:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'StrategyAction' from 'biomapper.core.strategy_actions.base'
```

This error occurs because the base class for strategy actions is defined as `BaseStrategyAction` in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/base.py`, but some strategy action implementations are attempting to import it using the name `StrategyAction`.

## 2. Task Objective
The objective is to resolve this `ImportError` to allow strategy actions to be imported and executed correctly by the `MappingExecutor`.

## 3. Scope of Work
- Modify the necessary Python file(s) within the `biomapper.core.strategy_actions` module to fix the import error.
- Ensure that both existing actions attempting to import `StrategyAction` and any potentially existing actions importing `BaseStrategyAction` will work correctly.

## 4. Deliverables
- The modified Python file(s) that resolve the `ImportError`.
- A brief explanation in the feedback of the chosen approach and why.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
- **Preferred Solution:** Add an alias in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/base.py` to make `StrategyAction` available. For example:
  ```python
  # In biomapper/core/strategy_actions/base.py
  BaseStrategyAction = ... # Existing class definition

  StrategyAction = BaseStrategyAction # Add this alias
  ```
- **Alternative Solution:** If the preferred solution is problematic, identify all files importing `StrategyAction` from `biomapper.core.strategy_actions.base` and change the import to `BaseStrategyAction`. This is less preferred due to the effort of finding all instances.
- **Testing:** While full integration tests are out of scope for this specific fix, ensure the change is syntactically correct and directly addresses the reported `ImportError`. The goal is to allow the import mechanism to work.
- **Code standards:** Adhere to existing code style, formatting, and type hinting practices in the Biomapper project.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
- If modifying `base.py` causes unexpected issues, revert the change.
- If attempting to modify individual action files and the scope becomes too large, halt and report this in the feedback.

## 7. Feedback Requirements
Please provide a feedback file in the standard format (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-feedback-fix-strategyaction-import-error.md`) detailing:
- **Summary of Changes:** Briefly describe the modifications made.
- **Files Modified:** List all files that were changed.
- **Chosen Solution:** Explain which solution was implemented and why.
- **Validation:** Confirm that the `ImportError` related to `StrategyAction` should no longer occur (e.g., by manually checking import statements or simple import tests if feasible).
- **Potential Issues/Risks:** Note any potential side effects or risks identified.
