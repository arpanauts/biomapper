# Task: Resolve ActionLoader, StrategyOrchestrator, and UniProt Client Errors

## Context:
Failures are occurring in tests for `ActionLoader`, `StrategyOrchestrator`, and UniProt clients. These include `AttributeError` and `ConfigurationError` for action loading, `KeyError` for context management in strategy orchestration, and various `AssertionError` and `KeyError` issues in UniProt client tests, suggesting problems with class loading, state management, API interaction, or data parsing.

## Objective:
Debug and fix the issues in `ActionLoader`, `StrategyOrchestrator`, and the UniProt clients to ensure correct dynamic loading of actions, robust strategy execution context, and reliable UniProt data retrieval and processing.

## Affected Tests & Errors:

**`tests/unit/core/test_action_loader.py`**
- `TestActionLoader::test_action_registry_lazy_loading` - `AttributeError: <module 'biomapper.core.engine_components.action_loader' ...>`
- `TestActionLoader::test_load_action_class_from_registry` - `AttributeError: property 'action_registry' of 'ActionLoader' object has no deleter`
- `TestActionLoader::test_load_action_class_invalid_type` - `AttributeError: property 'action_registry' of 'ActionLoader' object has no deleter`
- `TestActionLoader::test_load_action_class_attribute_error` - `assert 'does not have class' in "[CONFIGURATION_ERROR] Unexpected error loading action class 'test.module.MissingAction': issubclass() arg 1 must be a class"`
- `TestActionLoader::test_instantiate_action` - `biomapper.core.exceptions.ConfigurationError: [CONFIGURATION_ERROR] Failed to instantiate action 'TEST_ACTION': object.__init__() takes exactly one argument (the instan...`
- `TestActionLoader::test_module_caching` - `biomapper.core.exceptions.ConfigurationError: [CONFIGURATION_ERROR] Unexpected error loading action class 'test.module.TestAction': 'test.module'`

**`tests/core/engine_components/test_strategy_orchestrator.py`**
- `TestStrategyOrchestrator::test_context_updates_between_steps` - `KeyError: 'current_identifiers'`

**`tests/mapping/clients/test_uniprot_historical_resolver_client.py`**
- `TestUniProtHistoricalResolverClient::test_mock_primary_accession_resolution` - `AssertionError: Expected '_fetch_uniprot_search_results' to have been called once. Called 2 times.`
- `TestUniProtHistoricalResolverClient::test_mock_api_error_handling` - `AssertionError: assert False`
- `TestUniProtHistoricalResolverClient::test_cache_usage` - `AssertionError: assert 2 == 1`

**`tests/mapping/clients/uniprot/test_uniprot_mapping.py`**
- `test` - `KeyError: 'from_db'`

## Tasks:

1.  **`ActionLoader` (`test_action_loader.py`):**
    *   **AttributeErrors & ConfigurationErrors:** Review how actions are registered, loaded, and instantiated. 
        *   The `action_registry` property issue suggests a problem with its definition or how it's accessed (e.g., missing a setter or getter, or an issue with its deleter if defined as a property).
        *   Errors related to loading/instantiating specific test actions (`test.module.MissingAction`, `TEST_ACTION`, `test.module.TestAction`) point to problems in the dynamic import or class instantiation logic within `ActionLoader`.

2.  **`StrategyOrchestrator` (`test_strategy_orchestrator.py`):**
    *   **`KeyError: 'current_identifiers'`:** Investigate how the execution context is managed and passed between steps in the `StrategyOrchestrator`. The `current_identifiers` key is expected but missing, indicating a potential issue in a previous step not setting it, or the orchestrator not correctly propagating it.

3.  **UniProt Clients (`test_uniprot_historical_resolver_client.py`, `test_uniprot_mapping.py`):**
    *   **AssertionErrors in `TestUniProtHistoricalResolverClient`:**
        *   `_fetch_uniprot_search_results` called multiple times: Check the conditions under which this method is called; it might be an issue with caching logic or redundant calls.
        *   `assert False`: This is a generic failure; examine the test logic to understand what condition leads to this assertion.
        *   Cache usage `assert 2 == 1`: Review how caching is implemented and tested for the historical resolver. The expected cache interaction is not met.
    *   **`KeyError: 'from_db'` in `test_uniprot_mapping.py`:** This suggests that data retrieved or processed from UniProt is expected to have a `'from_db'` key, which is missing. Review the data parsing and transformation logic in this client.

## Expected Outcome:
All listed tests for `ActionLoader`, `StrategyOrchestrator`, and UniProt clients should pass, ensuring these components are robust and function as designed.
