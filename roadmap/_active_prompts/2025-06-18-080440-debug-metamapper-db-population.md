# Task: Debug and Fix Metamapper Database Population for UKBB-HPA Pipeline

## 1. Context
The `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script, which executes the `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT` strategy, is currently completing with exit code 0 but producing no output files in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/`.

This issue is believed to be caused by an outdated `metamapper.db` that does not reflect the corrected file paths for input data sources. The `configs/protein_config.yaml` file *has* been updated with correct, relative paths (using `${DATA_DIR}`), but this change needs to be propagated to the `metamapper.db`.

Placeholder data files (`data/hpa_osps.csv` and `data/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`) have been created to allow for end-to-end testing.

A previous attempt to run the `populate_metamapper_db.py` script failed due to an incorrect path to the script itself. The correct path has been identified as `scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py`.

## 2. Objective
The goal is to successfully populate the `metamapper.db` with the correct endpoint configurations from `configs/protein_config.yaml`, and then confirm that the `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` pipeline can successfully process the placeholder data and generate the expected output files.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  The `populate_metamapper_db.py` script runs without errors.
2.  The `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script runs without errors after the database is populated.
3.  Output files from the UKBB-HPA bidirectional mapping are present in the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/` directory.

## 3. Key Steps & Expected Outcomes

1.  **Populate Metamapper Database:**
    *   **Action:** Execute the `populate_metamapper_db.py` script with the correct path and arguments.
    *   **Command:** `poetry run python scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py --config-path configs/protein_config.yaml --entity-type protein --overwrite`
    *   **Working Directory:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The script completes with an exit code of 0. Logs should indicate successful reading of `protein_config.yaml` and updating/overwriting of protein entity configurations in `data/metamapper.db`.

2.  **Run Main UKBB-HPA Mapping Pipeline:**
    *   **Action:** Execute the `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` script.
    *   **Command:** `poetry run python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
    *   **Working Directory:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The script completes with an exit code of 0. Logs should now show activity related to loading identifiers from `UKBB_PROTEIN` and `HPA_OSP_PROTEIN`, performing mappings, reconciliation, and saving results.

3.  **Verify Output Files:**
    *   **Action:** Check the contents of the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/` directory.
    *   **Command:** `ls -la /home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The directory is no longer empty and contains files such as:
        *   `UKBB_PROTEIN_TO_HPA_OSP_PROTEIN_bidirectional_reconciliation_summary_<timestamp>.json`
        *   `UKBB_PROTEIN_TO_HPA_OSP_PROTEIN_bidirectional_reconciled_mappings_<timestamp>.csv`
        (The exact timestamp will vary).

## 4. Current State & Relevant Files
*   **Project Root:** `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/`
*   **Corrected Config:** `configs/protein_config.yaml` (contains `${DATA_DIR}/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv` and `${DATA_DIR}/hpa_osps.csv`)
*   **Database to Update:** `data/metamapper.db`
*   **Placeholder Data Files:**
    *   `data/hpa_osps.csv`
    *   `data/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`
*   **Script to Populate DB:** `scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py`
*   **Main Pipeline Script:** `scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
*   **Expected Output Directory:** `data/results/`

## 5. Implementation Requirements
*   **Input files/data:**
    *   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`
    *   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/data/hpa_osps.csv`
    *   `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/data/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`
*   **Expected outputs:**
    *   An updated `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/data/metamapper.db` file.
    *   JSON and CSV result files in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/data/results/`.
*   **Code standards:** N/A (running existing scripts).
*   **Validation requirements:**
    *   Verify exit codes of all commands (should be 0).
    *   Inspect logs for success messages or errors.
    *   Confirm the presence and non-emptiness of output files.

## 6. Error Recovery Instructions
*   **If `populate_metamapper_db.py` fails:**
    *   Carefully examine the full error message and traceback.
    *   Verify that the `--config-path` (`configs/protein_config.yaml`) and `--entity-type` (`protein`) arguments are correct.
    *   Ensure the `data/metamapper.db` file is writable and not corrupted. If suspected corruption, it might be necessary to delete it and let the script recreate it (though `--overwrite` should handle this).
    *   Check for any YAML syntax errors in `configs/protein_config.yaml` that might have been missed.
*   **If `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` still produces no output files after successful DB population:**
    *   Thoroughly review the logs from this script for any warnings or errors, especially during the `LoadEndpointIdentifiersAction` or `SaveBidirectionalResultsAction` steps.
    *   Confirm that the `initial_context` passed to `execute_yaml_strategy_robust` in `run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` correctly sets `strategy_output_directory` to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/`.
    *   Double-check the column names in the placeholder CSV/TSV files (`data/hpa_osps.csv`, `data/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`) against those expected by the `properties.mappings` in `configs/protein_config.yaml` for the `UKBB_PROTEIN` and `HPA_OSP_PROTEIN` endpoints. A mismatch could lead to zero identifiers being loaded.
