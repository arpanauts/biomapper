# Prompt: Fix Inconsistent Mapper Service Implementation

**Objective:**

Your task is to fix an inconsistent state in the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py` file. A previous operation added a method to a wrapper class but failed to add the corresponding implementation in the underlying service class. You must add the missing method implementation to make the service functional.

**File to Modify:**

*   `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper-api/app/services/mapper_service.py`

**Problem Description:**

The file contains two relevant classes: `MapperService` (a high-level wrapper) and `MapperServiceForStrategies` (the low-level implementation with database access). 

The `get_endpoints` method was added to `MapperService`, but the required implementation is missing from `MapperServiceForStrategies`. You must add it.

### **Implementation Steps**

1.  **Locate the `MapperServiceForStrategies` Class:** Find the definition for this class within the file.

2.  **Add the Missing `get_endpoints` Method:** Insert the following asynchronous method into the `MapperServiceForStrategies` class. A good location is right after the `_load_strategies` method and before the `execute_strategy` method.

    ```python
    async def get_endpoints(self) -> List[Endpoint]:
        """Retrieve all available endpoints from the database."""
        await self.ensure_executor_initialized()
        async with self.executor.get_session() as session:
            stmt = select(Endpoint)
            result = await session.execute(stmt)
            endpoints = result.scalars().all()
            logger.info(f"Retrieved {len(endpoints)} endpoints from the database.")
            return list(endpoints)
    ```

--- 

### **Verification**

After adding the method, the `mapper_service.py` file will be internally consistent. No further verification is needed for this specific task, as it is part of a larger feature implementation. The next step in the overall plan will be to create the API route that uses this new service method.
