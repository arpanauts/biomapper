# Task: Resolve Client & Adapter Errors - Group A (Arivale, CSV, Arango)

## Objective
Address a variety of errors (AttributeError, KeyError, AssertionError, TypeError) in tests for Arivale clients, CSVAdapter, and ArangoDB-related components.

## Affected Files/Modules
- `tests/mapping/clients/test_arivale_lookup_client.py`
- `tests/mapping/clients/test_arivale_reverse_lookup_client.py`
- `tests/mapping/clients/arivale/test_arivale_lookup.py`
- `tests/mapping/test_extractors.py` (specifically `CSVAdapter` related tests)
- `tests/mapping/adapters/test_csv_adapter.py`
- `tests/mapping/arango/test_arango_store.py`
- `tests/mapping/arango/test_base_arango.py`

## Common Error(s)
- `AssertionError`: Mismatched expected vs. actual results (e.g., set comparisons, value checks).
- `AttributeError`: Object does not have an expected attribute or method, often due to API changes or incorrect mocking.
- `KeyError`: Attempting to access a dictionary key that does not exist, often related to test data or API response structure.
- `TypeError`: Operation or function applied to an object of an inappropriate type (e.g., `object MockArango can't be used in 'await' expression`).

## Background/Context
This group of tests covers components responsible for interacting with specific data sources (Arivale, ArangoDB) or data formats (CSV). Failures can arise from:
- Internal refactoring of these client/adapter classes.
- Changes in the expected data format or API of these components.
- Outdated test data or mock configurations that no longer align with current code.
- Issues with asynchronous code, especially when mocking async methods or using async objects in synchronous contexts (or vice-versa).

## Debugging Guidance/Hypotheses

**General Approach:**
- **Isolate Tests:** Focus on one failing test file at a time.
- **Review Component Code:** Briefly look at the client or adapter code being tested to understand its current API and behavior.
- **Check Test Setup:** Examine how test data, mocks, and component instances are created.

**Specific Error Types:**
- **`AssertionError`:**
    - Carefully compare the expected and actual values. Print them out if necessary.
    - Verify that the test logic correctly generates the expected outcome based on the input and component's behavior.
    - For set comparisons, check for differences in elements, not just counts.
- **`AttributeError`:**
    - Check if the method or attribute name has changed in the component's class.
    - If using mocks, ensure the mock is configured with the necessary attributes/methods (e.g., using `spec` or `autospec`).
- **`KeyError`:**
    - Inspect the dictionary being accessed and the key being used.
    - If it's from a mocked API response, ensure the mock returns data with the expected keys.
    - If it's processing input data, ensure the test input data is correctly structured.
- **`TypeError` (e.g., `object MockArango can't be used in 'await' expression`):**
    - This often indicates an issue with mocking asynchronous code. If a method is `async def`, its mock should typically be an `AsyncMock` or a regular `MagicMock` whose `return_value` is an awaitable (e.g., a coroutine or another `AsyncMock`).
    - Ensure that `await` is used correctly with async functions and methods.

**For `tests/mapping/test_extractors.py` (`CSVAdapter`):**
- The errors `AttributeError: 'CSVAdapter' object has no attribute 'extract_ids_from_row'` and `'extract_id_from_cell'` suggest these methods might have been renamed, removed, or their functionality refactored within the `CSVAdapter` class.

**For Arango tests (`test_arango_store.py`, `test_base_arango.py`):**
- `AttributeError: 'ArangoStore' object has no attribute 'is_connected'`: This attribute might have been removed or renamed.
- `assert None is not None` / `assert 0 > 0`: These indicate that queries or operations are not returning expected data. Check mock setups for Arango client interactions or actual DB state if tests hit a real (test) Arango instance.
- `TypeError: object MockArango can't be used in 'await' expression`: Likely an issue with how async Arango client methods are mocked or called.

## Specific Error Examples
1.  `FAILED tests/mapping/clients/test_arivale_lookup_client.py::TestArivaleMetadataLookupClient::test_map_simple_identifiers - AssertionError: assert {'secondary_ids', 'errors', 'input_to_primary', 'primary_ids'} == {'NONEXISTENT', 'P67890', 'P12345'}`
2.  `FAILED tests/mapping/test_extractors.py::test_csv_adapter_extract_ids_from_row - AttributeError: 'CSVAdapter' object has no attribute 'extract_ids_from_row'`
3.  `FAILED tests/mapping/arango/test_arango_store.py::test_get_node - assert None is not None`
4.  `FAILED tests/mapping/arango/test_base_arango.py::test_get_node - TypeError: object MockArango can't be used in 'await' expression`

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests in the listed 'Affected Files/Modules' pass successfully.
- `AttributeError`s are resolved by updating tests to use correct API names or by fixing the components.
- `KeyError`s are resolved by correcting test data, mock responses, or data access logic.
- `AssertionError`s are resolved by aligning test expectations with actual component behavior or fixing bugs in components.
- `TypeError`s, especially those related to async operations, are resolved by correct usage and mocking of asynchronous code.
