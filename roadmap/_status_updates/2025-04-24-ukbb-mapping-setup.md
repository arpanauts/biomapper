# Biomapper Status Update: UKBB Endpoint Mapping Setup

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Pivoted from SPOKE Validation:** Temporarily shifted focus from resolving the SPOKE client configuration mismatch (ArangoDB client vs. REST API connection info) to test the core mapping infrastructure.
*   **Defined New UKBB Endpoint:** Successfully added a new endpoint entry (`UKBB_Metabolites`, ID 12) to the `endpoints` table in `metamapper.db` for the local file `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/procedure/data/local_data/HPP_PHENOAI_METADATA/UKBB_NMR_Meta.tsv`. Ensured the required `endpoint_type` ('data_source') and `connection_info` (file path, delimiter) were included.
*   **Established Mapping Relationship:** Created a new relationship (`MetabolitesCSV_to_UKBB`, ID 5) in `endpoint_relationships`, linking `MetabolitesCSV` (ID 7) as the source and `UKBB_Metabolites` (ID 12) as the target via entries in `endpoint_relationship_members`.
*   **Configured Ontology Preferences:**
    *   Confirmed `MetabolitesCSV` (source) has preferences including `PUBCHEM`.
    *   Added `NAME` as the primary preference (level 1) for `UKBB_Metabolites` (target) in `endpoint_ontology_preferences`, reflecting the structure of the UKBB file (which uses a `title` field).
*   **Defined Mapping Path:**
    *   Created a new mapping path (ID 78) in `mapping_paths` to define the transformation `PUBCHEM` -> `NAME`.
    *   This path utilizes the UniChem resource (ID 10) in two steps: `PUBCHEM` -> `ChEBI` and `ChEBI` -> `NAME`.
    *   Correctly linked this path (ID 78) to the `MetabolitesCSV_to_UKBB` relationship (ID 5) for the `PUBCHEM` -> `NAME` transformation in `relationship_mapping_paths`, replacing an incorrectly configured path based on 'InChIKey'.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Mapping Infrastructure:** The core relationship-based mapping configuration in `metamapper.db` is set up for the `MetabolitesCSV` -> `UKBB_Metabolites` scenario. The `RelationshipMappingExecutor` is ready to be tested with this new configuration.
*   **Database Schema:** The SQLite database schema (`endpoints`, `mapping_paths`, relationships tables, etc.) appears functional but evolving (e.g., the addition of `endpoint_type`).
*   **SPOKE Validation:** The code implementing SPOKE validation within `RelationshipMappingExecutor.map_entity` exists but remains blocked by the incompatibility between the `SpokeClient` (expecting ArangoDB connection details) and the stored `connection_info` for the SPOKE endpoint (containing REST API details).
*   **Mapping Cache:** The `mapping_cache` table exists with a `mapping_path` column intended for provenance, but the exact format/content stored in this column needs verification during testing.
*   **Overall:** The project has demonstrated flexibility in defining new endpoints and relationships. The immediate focus is on end-to-end testing of a file-to-file mapping using ontology translation resources.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architecture:** Continues to follow the relationship-based mapping architecture, separating endpoints from mapping resources and defining connections via database tables.
*   **Mapping Configuration:** Mappings are configured declaratively in the database:
    *   `endpoints`: Defines data sources/targets and connection info.
    *   `endpoint_relationships` & `endpoint_relationship_members`: Define source-target links.
    *   `endpoint_ontology_preferences`: Guides identifier selection.
    *   `mapping_paths`: Defines reusable, multi-step ontology translation sequences using specific `mapping_resources`.
    *   `relationship_mapping_paths`: Links specific paths to relationships for specific source/target ontology types.
*   **Key Challenge:** Mapping by `NAME` (as required for the UKBB target) is inherently less reliable than mapping by structured identifiers (e.g., PubChem, ChEBI) and is expected to have lower success rates. This setup provides a good test case for handling partial failures.
*   **Learnings:** Discovered the mandatory `endpoint_type` column in the `endpoints` table during insertion. Confirmed the structure of the `mapping_cache` table.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Test `MetabolitesCSV` -> `UKBB` Mapping:**
    *   Instantiate `RelationshipMappingExecutor`.
    *   Call `map_entity(relationship_id=5, source_entity='<PUBCHEM_ID>', source_ontology='PUBCHEM')` using an example PubChem ID from `metabolomics_metadata.tsv` (e.g., '1196').
    *   Analyze the results (success/failure, returned name, confidence).
    *   Inspect the entry created in the `mapping_cache` table, specifically the content of the `mapping_path` column.
*   **Investigate `map_entity` Source Preference Handling:** Verify how the executor handles calls where `source_ontology` is *not* provided. Does it correctly iterate through the source endpoint's preferences (e.g., HMDB > ChEBI > PubChem for MetabolitesCSV)?
*   **Address SPOKE Client Issue:** Revisit the SPOKE configuration discrepancy and decide whether to update the client to use the REST API or update the database `connection_info` to match the ArangoDB client.
*   **Refine NAME Mapping:** If NAME mapping proves highly unreliable, explore alternative strategies or resources for mapping the UKBB `title` field.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   How exactly does `RelationshipMappingExecutor.map_entity` select the source identifier when `source_ontology` is omitted? Does it align with the `endpoint_ontology_preferences` order?
*   What specific information (path ID, JSON steps?) is stored in the `mapping_cache.mapping_path` column upon successful mapping? Is it sufficient for clear provenance tracking?
*   What is the intended long-term approach for SPOKE interaction: Direct ArangoDB connection or REST API calls? This impacts `SpokeClient` implementation and required `connection_info`.
*   How should the system handle the expected low success rate of NAME-based mapping for the UKBB endpoint? What confidence threshold is appropriate?
