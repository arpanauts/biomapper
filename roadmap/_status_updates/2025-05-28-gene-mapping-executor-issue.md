## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **Gene Mapping Workaround Implementation (User-led):**
    - Significantly enhanced `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to support mapping UKBB UniProt Accession Numbers (UNIPROTKB_AC) to Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and QIN proteomics study Gene Names (GENE_NAME). This involved:
        - Adding/updating `Ontology` for `GENE_NAME`.
        - Defining new `MappingResource` entries (`HPA_Protein_Lookup_UniProt_to_Gene`, `QIN_Protein_Lookup_UniProt_to_Gene`) using `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` to look up gene names from UniProt ACs in respective CSV files.
        - Creating new `MappingPath` entries (`UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName`, `UKBB_UniProt_to_QIN_GeneName`) with `priority=1`.
        - Adding `EndpointRelationship` entries for `ukbb_protein_to_hpa_protein` and `ukbb_protein_to_qin_protein`.
        - Adding new `PropertyExtractionConfig` and `EndpointPropertyConfig` entries to handle gene name extraction for HPA/QIN and ensure correct UniProt column access for UKBB.
        - Updating `OntologyCoverage` for the new lookup resources.
        - Adding `RelationshipMappingPath` entries to link these new paths to the endpoint relationships.
        - Adding `argparse` for `--drop-all` functionality in `populate_metamapper_db.py`.
    - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` constants (`SOURCE_PROPERTY_NAME` to "UniProt", `TARGET_PROPERTY_NAME` to "gene") to align with the new gene mapping strategy.
- **Gene Mapping Workaround Attempt (Claude AI):**
    - A Claude Code instance attempted to implement the gene mapping workaround based on prompt `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/archive/2025-05-28-implement-ukbb-hpa-qin-gene-mapping-workaround.md` (now archived).
    - Modified `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` (changes superseded by more comprehensive user updates).
    - Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa_gene.py` and `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_qin_gene.py`.
    - Identified a critical issue: `MappingExecutor` preferred the non-functional identity path for HPA over the new gene mapping path.
    - QIN mapping to gene names was successful as no competing identity path was defined for QIN UniProt ACs.
    - Temporarily resolved a `qdrant_client` import error by commenting out the import in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/biomapper/vector_search_clients/__init__.py`.
- **Configuration:**
    - Updated `.gitignore` to potentially un-ignore output files (lines commented out).

## 2. Current Project State
- The primary goal of enabling UKBB-HPA and UKBB-QIN mappings via Gene Names is partially achieved.
- `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` is now configured for these new mapping strategies.
- The UKBB-QIN mapping to Gene Names is reported as functional by the Claude instance due to the absence of a conflicting identity path.
- **Critical Blocker:** The UKBB-HPA mapping to Gene Names is **not functional**. The `MappingExecutor` incorrectly prioritizes the existing (and known problematic for identity mappings) `UNIPROTKB_AC` to `UNIPROTKB_AC` path over the newly defined `UNIPROTKB_AC` to `GENE_NAME` path, despite the latter having `priority=1`. This prevents the workaround from being effective for HPA.
- The `qdrant_client` package is missing, but this is a minor issue for current priorities.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architectural Decision:** The strategy to map UKBB UniProt ACs to HPA/QIN Gene Names was adopted to circumvent the `MappingExecutor`'s issues with direct identity mappings (e.g., `UNIPROTKB_AC` to `UNIPROTKB_AC` between different endpoints).
- **`metamapper.db` Enhancements:** The database schema population script has been substantially updated to reflect new ontologies, resources, paths, and relationships required for this workaround.
- **`MappingExecutor` Path Selection:** The core issue now lies in the `MappingExecutor`'s path discovery and selection logic. It appears to favor identity paths regardless of defined priorities or the availability of alternative, viable non-identity paths for the same source/target endpoint relationship. The method `MappingExecutor._get_mapping_paths` is a key area for investigation.
- **Input Data:** Mappings are intended to use `UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv` (UniProt ACs in 'UniProt' column) as source, and HPA/QIN data from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/isb_osp/hpa_osps.csv` and `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/isb_osp/qin_osps.csv`.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Highest Priority:** Investigate and rectify the `MappingExecutor`'s path selection logic.
    - Analyze how `MappingExecutor._get_mapping_paths` (and related methods) selects paths, particularly when both identity and non-identity (e.g., ontology conversion) paths are available for an `EndpointRelationship`.
    - Determine why the `priority` field in the `MappingPath` table is not leading to the selection of the `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` path.
    - Implement changes to ensure the `MappingExecutor` can correctly prioritize or be explicitly guided to use the desired mapping paths. This might involve respecting priorities more strictly, or allowing paths to be enabled/disabled.
- **Testing:**
    - After addressing the `MappingExecutor` issue, thoroughly test the UKBB-HPA gene name mapping using `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py`.
    - Re-verify the UKBB-QIN gene name mapping using a script like `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_qin_gene.py` (or a user-created equivalent).
- **Dependency Management:**
    - (Low Priority) Decide whether to install `qdrant_client` or remove the dependency from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/biomapper/vector_search_clients/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml` if RAG functionality is not immediately planned.
- **Data Files:**
    - (Low Priority) Ensure mapping scripts are configured to use the full UKBB input file (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv`) once the core mapping logic is validated.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- What is the precise logic within `MappingExecutor` that causes it to select the identity path for HPA despite the presence of a `priority=1` gene name path?
- How can the `MappingExecutor` be made more flexible in path selection? Should there be an option to explicitly specify a path ID for a given mapping task if automatic selection is problematic?
- Is the current definition of "identity mapping" within `MappingExecutor` too broad, causing issues when source and target endpoints are different but happen to use the same ontology type for their primary identifiers?
