# Biomapper Status Update: PubChemRAGMappingClient Completion & Workflow Refinements

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

-   **`PubChemRAGMappingClient` Feature Completed (2025-05-23):**
    *   Successfully transitioned the `PubChemRAGMappingClient` feature through planning, an accelerated in-progress/implementation phase (leveraging Claude code instances), and to the "Completed" stage.
    *   The client, which uses semantic search against a Qdrant vector database of 2.3M PubChem embeddings, was fully implemented, tested (achieving 70-90 queries/second), and integrated.
    *   Key deliverables included:
        *   Client code: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/pubchem_rag_client.py`
        *   DB integration script: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/db_management/add_pubchem_rag_client.py`
        *   Test script: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/testing/test_pubchem_rag_client.py`
    *   Final documentation created: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/pubchem_rag_mapping_client/summary.md`.
    *   The `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_reference/completed_features_log.md` was updated.
    *   This work directly builds upon the recent completion of PubChem embedding filtering and Qdrant indexing.

-   **Workflow and Process Refinements (2025-05-23):**
    *   Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_starter_prompt.md` to include a "Source Prompt Reference" in prompts generated for Claude instances, enhancing traceability.
    *   Modified filename conventions in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_starter_prompt.md` to `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[description].md` for prompts and feedback files, ensuring chronological sorting.

-   **Foundation for RAG (Completed just prior, 2025-05-23):**
    *   Successfully filtered 89.4M PubChem embeddings to 2.3M biologically relevant compounds.
    *   Indexed these 2.3M embeddings into a Qdrant vector database, making them available for semantic search. This was crucial for the `PubChemRAGMappingClient`.

-   **Critical Bug Fix (Completed just prior, 2025-05-23):**
    *   Resolved the `is_one_to_many_target` flag bug in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`.

-   **MetaMapper Database CLI (Completed just prior, 2025-05-23):**
    *   Implemented and completed the CLI tool for managing `metamapper.db`.

## 2. Current Project State

-   **Overall Status:** The Biomapper project is making significant strides in enhancing its metabolite and protein mapping capabilities. The recent focus on RAG-based metabolite mapping has yielded a functional client.
-   **`PubChemRAGMappingClient`:** Completed, tested, and integrated. Ready for use and further evaluation.
-   **Qdrant Vector Database:** Operational, populated with 2.3M filtered PubChem embeddings, and successfully serving the `PubChemRAGMappingClient`.
-   **Metamapper Database & CLI:** Stable, providing robust configuration management for mapping resources and paths.
-   **Protein Mapping (Phase 3 Reconciliation):** Stable following the `is_one_to_many_target` bug fix.
-   **Roadmap/Workflow Process:** The prompt-driven development workflow with Cascade as Project Manager and Claude code instances for execution is proving effective and is being continuously refined.
-   **Outstanding Critical Issues:** No new critical blockers reported.
-   **Pending Decisions:** User to decide on reviewing architecture documents (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md` and `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/resource_metadata_system.md`) based on `PubChemRAGMappingClient` completion feedback.

## 3. Technical Context

-   **`PubChemRAGMappingClient`:**
    *   Extends `BaseMappingClient` for integration with the `MappingExecutor`.
    *   Utilizes `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model for generating query embeddings.
    *   Connects to Qdrant, performs cosine similarity searches.
    *   Features configurable similarity score thresholds (default 0.7).
-   **Qdrant Vector Database:**
    *   Collection: `pubchem_bge_small_v1_5`.
    *   Vectors: 384 dimensions, cosine distance metric, HNSW indexing.
-   **Development Workflow:**
    *   Managed by Cascade (AI Project Manager) using detailed prompts.
    *   Execution by Claude code instances.
    *   Iterative feedback loops and stage-gate progression for features.
    *   Key process document: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/_starter_prompt.md`.
-   **Recent `_starter_prompt.md` Enhancements:**
    *   Inclusion of source prompt path in generated prompts.
    *   Timestamp (HHMMSS) in filenames for chronological organization.

## 4. Next Steps

-   **USER Decision:** Await USER guidance on whether to proceed with reviewing the architecture documents suggested post-`PubChemRAGMappingClient` completion:
    *   `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md`
    *   `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/resource_metadata_system.md`
    (User to confirm actual paths or if these need to be created/found).
-   **USER Direction:** Await USER input to define the next primary feature or task for development within the Biomapper project.
-   **Potential Areas (if no immediate USER direction):**
    *   Applying the new `PubChemRAGMappingClient` to specific datasets (e.g., UKBB-Arivale metabolite mapping).
    *   Systematic evaluation and optimization of the `PubChemRAGMappingClient` (e.g., threshold tuning, caching strategies).
    *   Addressing other high-priority items from the project backlog or roadmap.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

-   **Architecture Review:** Should the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/rag_performance_evaluation_plan.md` and `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/architecture/resource_metadata_system.md` be updated or created based on the RAG client implementation? (Awaiting USER input).
-   **`PubChemRAGMappingClient` Enhancements (from completion feedback):**
    *   Optimal similarity threshold tuning based on broader production-like usage.
    *   Potential for extracting additional compound metadata from Qdrant payloads.
    *   Implementing result caching for frequently queried metabolites.
    *   Developing a systematic evaluation framework against known metabolite mappings.
-   **Long-term RAG Strategy:**
    *   How to handle metabolites not found even with RAG (currently ~30%+ success rate targeted, what about the rest)?
    *   Integration with LLM for adjudication or further reasoning if multiple good RAG hits.
