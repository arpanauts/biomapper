# Biomapper Status Update: Current Status & Executor Fixes

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Cache Database Schema Creation:** Fixed the `MappingExecutor.__init__` to reliably create the necessary tables (`EntityMapping`, `PathExecutionLog`, etc.) in the `mapping_cache.db` upon initialization.
*   **Cache Consistency Fix:** Debugged and resolved a critical inconsistency where `MappingExecutor.execute_mapping` returned different result formats depending on whether data came from the cache (string) or a live client call (list). The executor now consistently returns results as `Dict[str, Optional[List[str]]]`, wrapping cached string values in lists.
*   **UKBB->Arivale Script Fix:** The `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` script now correctly processes the results from the executor and generates an output CSV (`ukbb_arivale_mapping_output.csv`) containing the full, correct UniProt IDs.
*   **Logging Enhancements:** Added more detailed logging (including `DEBUG` level) during the debugging process to trace identifier mapping issues.
*   **Roadmap Update:** Added deferred tasks for handling failed mappings and noted the existing task for generalized identifier handling in `roadmap/_status_updates/2025-04-25-ukbb-arivale-mvp-roadmap.md`.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The basic UKBB->Arivale protein mapping pathway is functional using the `map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` script. The core `MappingExecutor` now correctly handles basic execution and caching for this specific pathway, including consistent result formatting. However, the *major refactoring* to make the executor fully dynamic and configuration-driven (as detailed in the previous roadmap) is still the **primary outstanding task**.
*   **Component Status:**
    *   `db/models.py` (Metamapper Config): Stable.
    *   `db/cache_models.py` (Cache Schema): Stable, tables created on executor init.
    *   `mapping_cache.db`: Functional, populated with UKBB->Arivale results.
    *   `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`: Sufficient for current protein framework focus.
    *   `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: Partially functional for the specific protein path; core logic for dynamic path finding and execution based on `metamapper.db` **still needs implementation (major refactoring required)**.
    *   `mapping/clients/`: `UniProtNameClient` is stable and functional.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:** The main blocker remains the need to refactor `MappingExecutor` according to the detailed plan in the `2025-04-25-ukbb-arivale-mvp-roadmap.md` to enable dynamic mapping based on database configuration.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Executor Result Consistency:** A key architectural decision reinforced recently is that the `MappingExecutor` *must* return results in a consistent format, regardless of the source (cache or live client). The standard format is now `Dict[str, Optional[List[str]]]`, ensuring downstream scripts can reliably process the output.
*   **Cache Initialization:** Ensured `CacheBase.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` is called during `MappingExecutor` initialization to prevent errors related to missing cache tables during runtime.
*   **Technology Stack:** Continues to rely on `asyncio` for asynchronous operations, `SQLAlchemy` (with `aiosqlite`) for database interactions (both config and cache), and `pandas` for data handling in scripts.

## 4. Next Steps

**Focus: Implement the Core Dynamic Mapping Framework (Refactor `MappingExecutor`)**

*   **Highest Priority:** Begin the **detailed refactoring of `MappingExecutor`** as outlined in `roadmap/_status_updates/2025-04-25-ukbb-arivale-mvp-roadmap.md`. This involves:
    1.  Implementing helper functions for querying `metamapper.db` (endpoints, paths).
    2.  Implementing robust pathfinding logic (`_find_mapping_paths`).
    3.  Designing and implementing a standard interface/adapter for mapping clients.
    4.  Implementing dynamic client instantiation and method calls based on DB config.
    5.  Developing comprehensive unit and integration tests for the refactored executor.
    6.  Integrating proper caching (`_check_cache`) and provenance logging (`_cache_results`) within the dynamic execution flow.
    7.  Performing end-to-end testing using the protein use case.
*   **Deferred Steps (Post-Core Framework):**
    *   Implement advanced fallback logic (UniProt->UMLS->UniChem->RAG, UniChem 404 handling) within the executor.
    *   Implement `UMLSClient`.
    *   Configure `metamapper.db` for metabolite endpoints and mapping paths.
    *   Implement metabolite mapping use cases.
    *   Integrate RAG component.
    *   Generalize identifier handling (composites, outdated IDs) across clients/executor.
    *   Implement logging/handling for failed mappings (e.g., to a separate table for retries).

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   How should the executor dynamically determine the correct client *method* to call for a given mapping step? (Standard interface? Configurable method name?) - *To be addressed during Executor Refactoring Phase 1, Step 3.*
*   What is the best strategy for finding/selecting mapping paths in `metamapper.db` (especially multi-step paths)? - *To be addressed during Executor Refactoring Phase 1, Step 2.*
*   How should the initial provenance data (path taken, confidence) be represented and stored in the cache? - *To be addressed during Executor Refactoring Phase 3, Step 6.*
*   _(Deferred)_ What are the rate limits and authentication requirements for the UMLS UTS API?
*   _(Deferred)_ What is the specific interface/input/output for the RAG component?
