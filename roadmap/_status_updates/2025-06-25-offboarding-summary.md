# Development Status Update - June 25, 2025

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Resolved Critical API Startup Failures:** Successfully diagnosed and fixed a series of persistent, cascading errors that prevented the `biomapper-api` from starting. The API is now stable and runnable.
    - **Dependency Management:** Fixed a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `structlog` package by correcting a corrupted Poetry environment. This involved forcing the creation of a new virtual environment and reinstalling all dependencies.
    - **Corrupted Package Fix:** Resolved a `numpy` import error by forcing the reinstallation of `pandas` and `numpy`, ensuring a clean and valid environment.
    - **Configuration Cleanup:** Moved legacy, non-strategy YAML files from the `configs` directory into a new `configs/legacy` subdirectory. This eliminated startup warnings and ensures the API only loads valid strategy files.
    - **Robust Startup Logging:** Refactored the `startup_event` in `app/main.py` and removed temporary debugging code to provide cleaner, production-ready error logging.

- **Validated End-to-End Pipeline:** Confirmed that the `biomapper-client` can successfully execute the `ukbb_hpa_analysis_strategy.yaml` through the now-functional `biomapper-api`, demonstrating a complete, working end-to-end data processing pipeline.

## 2. Current Project State

- **`biomapper-api` (Stable):** The backend API service is now in a stable, functional, and runnable state. The primary blockers that prevented its execution have been resolved.

- **`biomapper-ui` (Blocked - Rebuild Required):** The user interface is currently non-functional. A recent investigation documented in `roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-24-184500-ui-investigation-report.md` revealed a missing `package.json`, making it impossible to reliably manage dependencies. The official recommendation is to rebuild the UI from scratch.

- **Overall Architecture:** The project has successfully transitioned to a service-oriented architecture, with the core logic, API, and client now clearly separated and communicating effectively.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Rebuild the `biomapper-ui`:**
    - **Action:** Begin the UI rebuild as outlined in the investigation report. This involves initializing a new Vite/React project with TypeScript and reinstalling the necessary dependencies (`@mantine/core`, etc.).
    - **Goal:** Create a stable, modern UI foundation that can connect to the now-working backend API.

2.  **Enhance the `biomapper-api`:**
    - **Action:** Implement a `/api/health` endpoint. This is a standard practice for service monitoring and was part of the original service design plan.
    - **Goal:** Provide a simple way for clients and monitoring tools to check the health and status of the API server.

3.  **Finalize `MappingExecutor` Integration:**
    - **Action:** Replace any remaining mock implementations in `app/services/mapper_service.py` with the actual, fully functional `MappingExecutor` from the core `biomapper` library.
    - **Goal:** Enable the API to perform real, complex mapping operations beyond the already-validated strategy execution.

4.  **Update Documentation:**
    - **Action:** Update the main `README.md` or create a new developer guide.
    - **Goal:** Document the now-correct procedure for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies with Poetry, and running the `biomapper-api` server.

## 4. Open Questions & Considerations

- There are no major open questions at this time. The path forward is clear: focus on rebuilding the UI and continuing the planned enhancements for the backend API.
