# Status Update: Robust Executor Integration and Bidirectional Strategy Optimization

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Integrated RobustMappingExecutor Functionality into Core MappingExecutor:**
  - Created modular `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor_robust.py` implementing RobustExecutionMixin with checkpointing, retry logic, and batch processing capabilities
  - Developed `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor_enhanced.py` combining MappingExecutor with RobustExecutionMixin as a drop-in replacement
  - Successfully tested checkpoint functionality - confirmed checkpoints are saved after each batch (verified with 1,950/2,923 identifiers processed before timeout)
  - Checkpoint files properly store mapping results, processed count, and allow resumable execution

- **Resolved Critical Timeout Issues in Bidirectional Mapping:**
  - Identified design flaw in UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_OPTIMIZED strategy that attempted to resolve ALL ~2,992 unmatched HPA proteins even with small input sets
  - Fixed by switching to UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_EFFICIENT strategy which only processes forward resolution
  - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping_bidirectional.py` to use EFFICIENT strategy
  - Reduced batch sizes from 250 to 25 and increased retries from 3 to 5 for better timeout handling

- **Successfully Completed Full Dataset Mapping:**
  - Processed all 2,923 UKBB protein identifiers using the EFFICIENT bidirectional strategy
  - Achieved 16.9% coverage with 493 HPA genes successfully mapped (490 direct UniProt matches)
  - Generated comprehensive results at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/ukbb_to_hpa_mapping_results_efficient.csv`
  - Created detailed report at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/ukbb_to_hpa_detailed_report_efficient.md`
  - Produced visualization data at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/ukbb_to_hpa_flow_efficient.json`

- **Fixed Context Variable Handling in YAML Strategies:**
  - Corrected inconsistent context variable references in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml`
  - Changed from mixed "context.variable" and "variable" syntax to consistent "variable" references
  - Fixed fields: save_unmatched_target_to, input_from, append_matched_to, save_final_unmatched
  - Reloaded database with populate_metamapper_db.py after fixes

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall:** The biomapper project now has robust execution capabilities integrated into the core MappingExecutor. The bidirectional mapping strategies are optimized and working efficiently without timeout issues. Full dataset mappings can be completed reliably.

- **Enhanced Mapping Executor:**
  - EnhancedMappingExecutor fully functional with checkpoint support, retry logic, and batch processing
  - Checkpointing works correctly for `process_in_batches` method but not yet implemented for `execute_yaml_strategy_robust`
  - Progress callbacks successfully report batch completion and checkpoint saves
  - Robust features configurable via parameters: checkpoint_enabled, batch_size, max_retries, retry_delay

- **Bidirectional Mapping Strategies:**
  - EFFICIENT strategy recommended for production use - completes in under 2 minutes for full dataset
  - OPTIMIZED strategy has design flaw and should be deprecated or fixed to limit reverse resolution
  - All context-based tracking working correctly throughout strategy execution
  - New reporting action types (GENERATE_MAPPING_SUMMARY, EXPORT_RESULTS, GENERATE_DETAILED_REPORT, VISUALIZE_MAPPING_FLOW) functioning properly

- **Outstanding Issues:**
  - `execute_yaml_strategy_robust` method doesn't implement actual checkpointing during strategy execution (only wraps standard method)
  - Post-processing phase times out when creating comprehensive DataFrames for large datasets (though core mapping completes)
  - Export results format shows UNMAPPED entries separately from NEW entries (HPA genes) which may be confusing

## 3. Technical Context

- **RobustExecutionMixin Architecture:**
  - Implements save_checkpoint/load_checkpoint/clear_checkpoint methods using pickle serialization
  - process_in_batches method fully implements incremental checkpointing with resume capability
  - execute_with_retry provides configurable retry logic for external API calls
  - Progress tracking via callbacks enables real-time monitoring of long-running operations

- **Checkpoint Implementation Details:**
  - Checkpoints stored in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/checkpoints/` as pickle files
  - Checkpoint data includes: mapping_results, processed_count, total_count, processor name, checkpoint_time
  - Successfully tested with ukbb_hpa_batch_20250615_174334.checkpoint containing 1,950 processed items

- **Strategy Execution Flow:**
  - Bidirectional strategies now use consistent context variable references without "context." prefix
  - EFFICIENT strategy flow: BIDIRECTIONAL_MATCH → RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_FORWARD → COLLECT_MATCHED_TARGETS → CONVERT_IDENTIFIERS_LOCAL → reporting actions
  - Batch processing with configurable sizes prevents memory issues and allows granular progress tracking

## 4. Next Steps

- **Implement Full Checkpointing for Strategy Execution:**
  - Enhance execute_yaml_strategy_robust to save checkpoints after each strategy step
  - Allow resumption from specific steps rather than restarting entire strategy
  - Consider implementing step-level retry logic for failed actions

- **Optimize Post-Processing Performance:**
  - Investigate timeout issues during DataFrame creation for large result sets
  - Consider streaming results to CSV instead of building full DataFrame in memory
  - Implement chunked processing for final results assembly

- **Improve Results Export Format:**
  - Consolidate UNMAPPED and NEW entries into a cleaner format
  - Add proper source-to-target mapping in single rows instead of separate entries
  - Include mapping provenance information in export

- **Production Readiness:**
  - Create comprehensive documentation for robust execution features
  - Add configuration examples for different use cases (small vs large datasets)
  - Implement monitoring/alerting for checkpoint-based workflows

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **Checkpoint Storage Strategy:**
  - Should checkpoints be automatically cleaned after successful completion?
  - Consider implementing checkpoint retention policies or archival
  - Evaluate checkpoint format (pickle vs JSON) for long-term storage

- **Strategy Design Patterns:**
  - Should we create guidelines to prevent strategies from processing entire target datasets?
  - Consider implementing resource limits or warnings for potentially expensive operations
  - Evaluate need for strategy validation before execution

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Is the current batch size of 25-50 optimal for API rate limits?
  - Should we implement parallel batch processing for independent operations?
  - Consider caching strategy for frequently accessed endpoint data

- **Error Handling Enhancement:**
  - Should we implement more granular error categories for better retry decisions?
  - Consider adding fallback strategies when primary resolution methods fail
  - Evaluate need for partial result recovery from failed batches
