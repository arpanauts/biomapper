# Development Status Update - MVP Architecture & Documentation Cleanup

**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Focus:** Major architecture simplification, documentation overhaul, and project cleanup

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

### Major Architecture Simplification
- **Legacy Code Removal**: Removed ~75% of codebase including database, cache, RAG/LLM, and UI components
- **MVP Action System**: Streamlined to 3 core actions that handle most biological mapping scenarios:
  - `LOAD_DATASET_IDENTIFIERS` - Load identifiers from CSV/TSV files
  - `MERGE_WITH_UNIPROT_RESOLUTION` - Merge datasets with historical UniProt resolution  
  - `CALCULATE_SET_OVERLAP` - Calculate overlap statistics and generate Venn diagrams
- **MinimalStrategyService**: Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/minimal_strategy_service.py` to replace complex MappingExecutor with simple YAML strategy loading
- **Database Removal**: Completely removed metamapper.db dependencies, moving to file-based YAML strategies

### Documentation Complete Overhaul
- **ReadTheDocs Restructure**: Completely rewrote documentation structure in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/source/`
- **New User Guides**: Created comprehensive quickstart, installation, and tutorial documentation
- **MVP Action Reference**: Detailed documentation for each of the 3 core actions
- **Architecture Documentation**: Updated all architecture docs to reflect current streamlined system
- **README Update**: Completely rewrote `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/README.md` to reflect MVP architecture

### Project Root Cleanup
- **File Reduction**: Cleaned project root from 28 files to 13 essential files (53% reduction)
- **Legacy Removal**: Removed analysis files, development scripts, and database migration files
- **Configuration Updates**: Updated `conftest.py` and removed legacy `.env_template`

### Roadmap Documentation Cleanup
- **Legacy Reference Removal**: Systematically removed documentation referencing removed components
- **MVP Focus**: Preserved only documentation relevant to current 3-action architecture
- **Organizational Cleanup**: Removed 7 directories and 15+ files with legacy references

### Test Suite Restoration
- **Test Recovery**: Restored essential MVP action tests from git history
- **Test Results**: 58/61 tests passing with only 2 minor failures related to enhanced CSV timing metrics
- **Test Structure**: Recreated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/` directory structure for MVP actions

## 2. Current Project State

### Stable Components
- **Core MVP Actions**: All 3 actions fully functional and tested
- **YAML Strategy System**: Working strategy execution via `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/minimal_strategy_service.py`
- **REST API**: Functional at `biomapper-api/` using FastAPI
- **Python Client**: Working async client in `biomapper_client/`
- **Documentation**: Complete ReadTheDocs-ready documentation structure

### Active Development Areas
- **Performance Optimization**: Timing metrics added but some tests need updating
- **Strategy Examples**: Working configs in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/`
- **Integration Testing**: Manual testing successful, automated integration tests minimal

### Outstanding Items
- **2 Test Failures**: Related to CSV column format expectations (timing metrics added)
- **Git State**: Large number of deletions and modifications ready for commit
- **Documentation Build**: Successfully builds with minor warnings about legacy cross-references

## 3. Technical Context

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **No Database**: Moved from SQLAlchemy/Alembic to pure file-based YAML strategies  
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Drastically reduced complexity by removing unnecessary components
- **API-First**: All functionality accessible through REST API with Python client wrapper
- **Type Safety**: Maintained Pydantic models for data validation throughout MVP actions

### Core Data Flow
1. **YAML Strategy Loading**: MinimalStrategyService loads and validates strategy files
2. **Context-Based Execution**: Shared dictionary passes data between sequential action steps
3. **File-Based I/O**: CSV/TSV input files, SVG/CSV output files, no persistent storage
4. **REST API Wrapper**: FastAPI exposes strategy execution via HTTP endpoints

### Implementation Patterns
- **Action Registry**: Dynamic loading of actions via decorator pattern
- **Pydantic Validation**: Type-safe parameter and result models
- **Async/Await**: Consistent async patterns throughout API and client
- **Context Keys**: String-based data passing between actions (e.g., "ukbb_proteins", "overlap_stats")

## 4. Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (This Week)
1. **Commit Current Changes**: Organize and commit the extensive cleanup work
2. **Fix Test Failures**: Update 2 failing tests to account for timing metrics columns
3. **ReadTheDocs Deployment**: Ensure documentation builds and deploys correctly
4. **Integration Validation**: Run full end-to-end mapping scenarios to validate cleanup

### Development Priorities
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Validate that simplified architecture performs well with large datasets
2. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve error messages and validation in MinimalStrategyService
3. **Strategy Examples**: Create more comprehensive example strategies for different use cases
4. **Client SDK Polish**: Enhance biomapper_client with better error handling and documentation

### Infrastructure Tasks
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing and deployment
2. **Docker Integration**: Containerize the simplified architecture
3. **Monitoring**: Add basic logging and metrics for API usage
4. **Security Review**: Validate API endpoints and file handling security

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Chemical Mapping Clients**: Preserved valuable clients (ChEBI, PubChem, etc.) - should these be converted to new action types?
- **Performance vs Simplicity**: Current architecture prioritizes simplicity - when to add optimizations?
- **Error Recovery**: How much error handling/retry logic to add to MinimalStrategyService?

### Future Architecture
- **Scaling**: How to handle very large datasets (>1M rows) with current file-based approach?
- **Caching**: Should we add back lightweight caching for UniProt API calls?
- **Parallel Execution**: Could strategy steps be parallelized for better performance?

### Documentation & Maintenance
- **Legacy Documentation**: Some warnings remain about missing cross-references - worth fixing?
- **Version Management**: How to handle breaking changes in this simplified architecture?
- **Migration Guide**: Should we create a guide for users migrating from complex to MVP version?

### Research & Exploration
- **Alternative Serialization**: Would Parquet/Arrow be better than CSV for intermediate data?
- **Streaming Processing**: For very large datasets, should we implement streaming?
- **Plugin Architecture**: How extensible should the action system be for custom biological databases?

## Summary

The biomapper project has undergone a major transformation, moving from a complex multi-component system to a streamlined MVP architecture focused on 3 core actions and YAML-based strategies. The documentation has been completely overhauled to reflect this new reality, and the project structure has been dramatically simplified. The system is now much more maintainable and approachable while retaining all essential biological data mapping functionality.

The next phase should focus on validating this simplified architecture in production scenarios and ensuring the documentation deployment pipeline works correctly.
