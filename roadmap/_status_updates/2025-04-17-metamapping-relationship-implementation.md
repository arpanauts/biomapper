# Biomapper Development Status Update: Metamapping Relationship Implementation

## 1. Recent Accomplishments

- Successfully implemented a proof-of-concept for endpoint-to-endpoint mapping using the Metamapping Engine
- Integrated real API calls to UniChem service for translating between ontology types
- Created a relationship-based mapping architecture that clearly separates endpoints from mapping resources
- Implemented automatic discovery and storage of optimal mapping paths between endpoints
- Added caching functionality to store successful mappings in the database for future reuse
- Created a fallback mechanism when primary mapping resources (like UniChem API) fail
- Successfully mapped HMDB identifiers to ChEBI identifiers with high confidence

## 2. Current Project State

- **Metamapping Engine**: Stable and functional, capable of finding and executing multi-step mapping paths
- **Relationship Mapping**: Working implementation with path discovery and execution capabilities
- **Resource Adapters**: 
  - Test adapter: Stable and working as fallback
  - UniChem adapter: Initial implementation working but needs refinement for proper ID formatting
- **Database Schema**: Properly configured with tables for endpoints, relationships, mapping paths, and mapping cache
- **Outstanding Issues**:
  - UniChem adapter returns 404 errors for HMDB IDs, likely due to format expectations

## 3. Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Using a relationship-based design where endpoints (data sources like MetabolitesCSV and SPOKE) are connected through defined relationships, and mapping resources (ontology translation tools like UniChem) are used to translate between different ontology types
- **Key Components**:
  - `RelationshipPathFinder`: Discovers and stores optimal mapping paths between endpoints
  - `RelationshipMappingExecutor`: Executes endpoint-to-endpoint mappings using the Metamapping Engine
  - `SimpleMetamappingEngine`: Core engine that executes multi-step mapping paths
  - `UniChemAdapter`: Makes real API calls to the UniChem service
- **Database Design**:
  - `relationship_mapping_paths`: Stores discovered mapping paths between endpoints
  - `mapping_cache`: Caches successful mapping results for reuse
  - `relationship_mappings`: Links relationship IDs to mapping cache entries
- **Key Algorithms**: 
  - Path discovery using ontology preferences to score and rank potential mapping paths
  - Multi-step mapping execution with confidence propagation

## 4. Next Steps

- Fix the UniChem adapter to properly format HMDB IDs (remove "HMDB" prefix)
- Add more robust error handling and retry logic for external API calls
- Implement performance metrics collection to identify optimal mapping paths
- Explore additional mapping resources beyond UniChem
- Create a cleanup mechanism for stale cache entries
- Integrate this functionality with the main Biomapper codebase
- Expand testing with a broader range of real-world metabolite identifiers

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- What is the optimal caching strategy? Should we implement time-based expiration?
- How should we handle conflicts when multiple mapping paths provide different results?
- Should we implement bidirectional mappings for all relationships automatically?
- What metrics should we track to evaluate mapping quality and performance?
- How can we optimize the UniChem adapter to handle batch requests for better performance?
- Should we consider parallel execution for multi-step mapping paths?
- Is there a need for a more sophisticated confidence scoring model beyond simple multiplication?
