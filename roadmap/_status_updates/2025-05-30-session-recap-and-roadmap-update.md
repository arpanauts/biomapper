# Status Update: Session Recap, Performance Fix, and Roadmap Update

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **`MappingExecutor` Performance Optimization (Critical Fix):**
    - Diagnosed and resolved a severe performance bottleneck in `MappingExecutor.execute_mapping` (previously causing overnight runs).
    - Implemented client instance caching (`_client_cache` in `MappingExecutor._load_client`) to avoid repeated instantiation and costly re-loading of clients (e.g., `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` with its large CSV).
    - Achieved a ~93.7% performance improvement (e.g., from ~5.6s to ~0.35s for subsequent operations using cached clients), effectively a ~16x speedup.
    - Documented in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/mapping_executor_performance_optimization/`.
- **Update `populate_metamapper_db.py` for UKBB/Arivale File Resources:**
    - Enhanced `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to include new `MappingResource` definitions for file-based lookups using UKBB protein metadata (`UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`) and improved Arivale protein metadata (`proteomics_metadata.tsv`).
    - Added a new `UKBB_ASSAY_ID` ontology and bidirectional mappings between `UKBB_ASSAY_ID` and `UNIPROTKB_AC`.
    - Corrected configurations for Arivale lookup resources (e.g., added delimiters, verified file paths/columns).
    - Leveraged the existing `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` for these file-based lookups.
    - Documented in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/update_populate_metamapper_db_ukbb_arivale/`.
- **Fix `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` One-To-Many Bug:**
    - Resolved a bug in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` where the `is_one_to_many_target` flag was incorrectly set to TRUE for all records.
    - The fix involved filtering for valid mappings (non-null source and target IDs) before calculating value counts and setting flags.
    - Ensured accurate identification of one-to-many relationships for downstream canonical mapping selection.
    - Documented in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/fix_phase3_one_to_many_bug/`.
- **Roadmap Stage Update:**
    - Successfully moved the three aforementioned features to the `3_completed` stage in the project roadmap.
    - Generated `README.md`, `implementation_notes.md`, and `summary.md` for each completed feature.
    - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_reference/completed_features_log.md`.

## 2. Current Project State
- **Overall:** The Biomapper project has made significant progress by resolving a critical performance blocker and completing several key data integration and bug-fix tasks. The core mapping functionality is now much more robust and performant.
- **`MappingExecutor`:** Now significantly more performant and stable due to client caching. The iterative mapping logic is functionally complete.
- **`populate_metamapper_db.py`:** Updated with new UKBB and Arivale file-based resources, expanding data coverage.
- **`phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`:** More reliable due to the one-to-many bug fix.
- **Roadmap:** Accurately reflects recent completions.
- **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:** None identified during this session. The primary blocker (MappingExecutor performance) has been resolved.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architectural Decision (Performance):** Client instance caching (`_client_cache` dictionary in `MappingExecutor`) using a cache key based on resource name, class path, and configuration hash is now a core part of `MappingExecutor`'s strategy to handle expensive client initializations.
- **Architectural Decision (Data Population):** `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` is confirmed as the de-facto generic client for file-based lookups, configured via `config_template` in `MappingResource`.
- **Learnings:**
    - Profiling and targeted logging were essential in pinpointing the `MappingExecutor` bottleneck.
    - Careful handling of NULLs and filtering for valid data is crucial in data reconciliation scripts like `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`.
- **Key Files Updated/Fixed:**
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`

## 4. Next Steps
- **Monitor Production/Large-Scale Performance:** While tests show massive improvements, monitor `MappingExecutor` with larger, production-like datasets to ensure the caching strategy holds and to identify any further, more subtle bottlenecks.
- **Architecture Review Based on Recent Fixes:**
    - Consider cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU) for `MappingExecutor._client_cache` if memory becomes a concern with many diverse clients.
    - Evaluate if `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` needs refactoring into a more generic base class if its use for various file types expands further.
    - Add more targeted unit tests for `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` focusing on edge cases for one-to-many flag generation.
- **Data Validation and Quality Checks:** With improved mapping capabilities, focus on validating the quality and coverage of mappings produced, especially for newly integrated UKBB data.
- **Address `TODO`s and Refinements:** Review the codebase for any `TODO` comments or minor refinements identified during recent debugging sessions.
- **Continue with Roadmap:** Consult `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/README.md` and `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_backlog/` for the next set of prioritized features.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- **Cache Management:** What is the optimal strategy for managing the `_client_cache` in `MappingExecutor` long-term (e.g., size limits, eviction, pre-warming)?
- **Data Discrepancies:** Are there remaining data quality issues in input files (e.g., `UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv` gene names mentioned in MEMORY[37e78782-dd9b-4c37-b305-9c17a323373c]) that might affect mapping success rates even with a functional executor?
- **Scalability of Reconciliation:** How does `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` perform with very large datasets post-fix?
