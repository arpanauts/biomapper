# Status Update: Protein Configuration Alignment and YAML System Validation

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **`protein_config.yaml` Aligned with Iterative Mapping Strategy:**
    - Successfully reviewed and updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` to comprehensively align with the documented iterative mapping strategy (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/core_mapping_logic/iterative_mapping_strategy.md`).
    - **Ontology Definitions:** Added `PROTEIN_ENSEMBL_GENE_ONTOLOGY`.
    - **Property Mappings:**
        - Added `PROTEIN_ENSEMBL_GENE_ONTOLOGY` mapping for Arivale.
        - Ensured `PROTEIN_GENE_NAME_ONTOLOGY` mapping for UKBB.
        - Corrected `value_column` configurations for SPOKE and KG2 UniProt lookup clients to match their respective property definitions.
    - **Secondary-to-Primary Conversion Clients:** Added `ensembl_protein_to_uniprot` (using `UniProtEnsemblProteinMappingClient`) and `ensembl_gene_to_uniprot` (using `UniProtIDMappingClient`) to the `additional_resources` section. The existing `uniprot_name_search` client (using `UniProtNameClient`) serves for gene name to UniProt conversions.
    - **`OntologyPreference` Structure:** Implemented the new top-level `ontology_preferences` section, populating it for `UKBB_PROTEIN` and `ARIVALE_PROTEIN` to guide the `MappingExecutor`'s secondary conversion choices.
    - **Mapping Paths:** Reviewed and uncommented the `UKBB_TO_HPP_UNIPROT_IDENTITY` mapping path, correcting its `source_type` and steps to accurately reflect its purpose (UKBB Assay ID -> UniProt -> HPP UniProt Identity Check).
- **YAML Configuration System Validated for Proteins:**
    - Successfully ran the refactored `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` script with the updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.
    - The script parsed the YAML, validated its contents (including ontology and client references, file path resolutions for `${DATA_DIR}`), and populated the `metamapper.db` without errors. This confirms the structural integrity and referential consistency of the protein configuration.
- **Foundational Work (Previous Sessions, Context from Memory):**
    - Refactored `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to parse entity configurations from multiple YAML files (MEMORY[80172bfd-815a-4879-a515-32fc8c50e37c]). This included implementing YAML parsing, modular population functions, a `ConfigurationValidator`, and environment variable resolution.
    - Generated the initial comprehensive `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` for 6 protein data sources (Arivale, UKBB, HPP, Function Health, SPOKE, KG2) (MEMORY[1c239c6a-0dba-40bd-b8ae-01cba32db9c7]).

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall:** The Biomapper project has successfully transitioned to a YAML-driven configuration system for protein data. The system is validated, and the protein configuration is significantly more aligned with the advanced iterative mapping strategy.
- **Configuration Management:**
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` is the active and validated configuration for protein mappings.
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` is stable and functional for parsing YAML configurations and populating `metamapper.db`.
- **`MappingExecutor`:** Considered stable and performant (following client caching fixes from `2025-05-30-session-recap-and-roadmap-update.md`). It is ready to be tested with the newly populated protein configuration.
- **Entity Coverage:** Protein mapping configuration is the most advanced. Other entity types (metabolites, etc.) will follow this YAML-based model.
- **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:** No immediate critical code blockers. The next phase involves testing the actual mapping execution using the new configuration.

## 3. Technical Context

- **Architectural Decision (Configuration):** YAML-based configuration per entity type (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`) is the standard. These files define `ontologies`, `databases` (with `endpoints`, `properties`, `mapping_clients`), `additional_resources` (for shared clients), `mapping_paths`, and `ontology_preferences`.
- **Data Population:** `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` serves as the central script to parse all `configs/*.yaml` files, validate them, and populate the `metamapper.db`.
- **Iterative Mapping Strategy:** The `protein_config.yaml` now supports key elements of this strategy, including primary shared ontologies, secondary-to-primary conversions, and ontology preferences to guide these conversions.
- **Key Clients Utilized/Configured:** `GenericFileLookupClient`, `UniProtNameClient`, `UniProtEnsemblProteinMappingClient`, `UniProtIDMappingClient`.
- **Environment Variables:** `${DATA_DIR}` is consistently used for file paths and resolved by the population script.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Test Protein Mapping Execution:**
    *   Utilize the `MappingExecutor` with the newly configured and populated `metamapper.db` (from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`).
    *   Perform test mappings between various protein sources (e.g., Arivale to UKBB, UKBB to HPP using the identity path).
    *   Verify that the iterative mapping logic correctly uses `ontology_preferences` and secondary conversion clients.
2.  **Complete Function Health Configuration:**
    *   Address the deferred item D: Define detailed property mappings and any necessary placeholder conversion clients for the Function Health data source in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.
3.  **Develop Integration Tests:**
    *   Create integration tests for the `MappingExecutor` that specifically use the YAML-configured `metamapper.db` to ensure end-to-end mapping correctness for protein data.
4.  **Begin Next Entity Type Configuration (e.g., Metabolites):**
    *   Create `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/metabolite_config.yaml`.
    *   Define ontologies, databases, properties, clients, and paths for metabolite data sources, following the established pattern.
5.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update any relevant documentation to reflect the YAML-based configuration approach and the structure of the entity config files.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **`OntologyPreference` in `MappingExecutor`:** While the `ontology_preferences` section is now in `protein_config.yaml` and `metamapper.db`, the `MappingExecutor`'s logic to actively use these preferences during its iterative mapping needs to be explicitly tested and verified.
- **Data File Availability and Format:** Ensure all data files referenced by `GenericFileLookupClient` instances in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` (e.g., `${DATA_DIR}/arivale_data/proteomics_metadata.tsv`) are present in the expected locations and formats. The population script warns about missing files but doesn't halt; actual mapping will fail if files are missing.
- **Scalability of YAML Configuration Management:** As more entity types are added, managing a growing number of YAML files and ensuring consistency across them will be important.
- **Error Handling in `MappingExecutor` for Config Issues:** Further test how `MappingExecutor` handles scenarios where a selected path or client might have subtle misconfigurations not caught by the initial `populate_metamapper_db.py` validation.
