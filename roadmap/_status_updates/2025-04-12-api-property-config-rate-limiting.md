# API Property Configuration and Rate Limiting Improvements

## 1. Recent Accomplishments

- Implemented proper rate limiting in the KEGG client to respect the API's restriction of 3 requests per second
- Added a comprehensive rate limiting framework in the `ResourceVerifier` class to handle different API limits for each resource
- Enhanced the `_parse_compound_entry` method in the KEGG client to better handle KEGG's text format
- Improved KEGG property extraction configurations, increasing success rate from 18.2% to 63.6%
- Redesigned the RefMet client to utilize a local CSV file (~187,000 entries) for faster and more reliable lookups
- Fixed RefMet API endpoint URLs to align with the Metabolomics Workbench REST API specifications
- Implemented multi-level fallback strategies in RefMet client (local CSV → REST API → legacy endpoints)
- Created diagnostic scripts for analyzing KEGG and RefMet data formats to better understand extraction patterns
- Added verification script to test API property extractions across all resources

## 2. Current Project State

- The biomapper project now has improved resource clients that respect API rate limiting policies
- KEGG client has a 63.6% success rate for property extractions (up from 18.2%)
- The RefMet client successfully integrates with both local data (CSV) and the REST API
- The verification system has been enhanced with resource-specific rate limiting
- 6 out of 8 configured resources are now verified successfully
- 2 resources still have client implementation issues:
  - MetabolitesCSV client is missing implementation
  - SPOKE (ArangoDB) client is missing implementation
- The local RefMet CSV file with ~187,000 entries is now utilized for faster lookups
- Rate limiting is properly implemented for both KEGG (3 requests/second) and other APIs with appropriate defaults

## 3. Technical Context

### Rate Limiting Architecture
- Implemented a dictionary of rate limits specific to each API in the `ResourceVerifier.API_RATE_LIMITS` attribute
- Added time tracking between requests to enforce proper intervals based on API requirements
- Incorporated small random jitter to prevent synchronized requests
- Implemented an adaptive sleep mechanism that only waits when necessary

### KEGG Data Format Analysis
- Discovered that KEGG's text format requires more robust regex patterns without anchors (^) for reliable extraction
- Identified that some properties (HMDB ID, InChI, SMILES) are not consistently present in KEGG compound entries
- Updated patterns to use specific data type patterns (e.g., `[\d\.]+` for numeric fields)

### RefMet Integration Strategy
- Identified distinction between RefMet standardized nomenclature and Metabolomics Workbench repository
- Implemented a hybrid approach utilizing:
  1. Local CSV file (`data/refmet/refmet.csv`) as primary data source
  2. REST API endpoints with the "refmet" context as fallback
  3. Legacy database endpoints as last resort
- Added multiple search strategies (exact match, partial match, term decomposition)

## 4. Next Steps

- Fix remaining issues with RefMet URL construction for entity lookups
  - Current error: `404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/databases/refmet/refmet/name/1/all`
  - URL path appears to have duplicate segments that need correction

- Implement the missing clients:
  - Create a base implementation for the MetabolitesCSV client
  - Implement the SPOKE/ArangoDB client for graph database integration

- Further improve KEGG property extraction:
  - Mark certain properties (HMDB ID, InChI, SMILES) as optional in configurations
  - Consider implementing secondary lookups to other databases for missing properties

- Enhance verification reporting:
  - Add more detailed error analysis to help debug extraction failures
  - Create visual reports showing extraction success rates by property and resource

- Optimize rate limiting parameters:
  - Fine-tune rate limits based on observed API performance
  - Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on response times

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- Should we implement a caching layer for API responses to reduce external requests?
- Is it worth implementing a proxy service or queue for high-volume API interactions?
- How should we handle the inconsistent availability of certain properties across different databases?
- Should we continue using regular expressions for property extraction, or would a more structured parser be more maintainable?
- How do we best handle API changes or outages from external services?
- Should we implement automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient API failures?
- What monitoring systems should we put in place to detect when APIs change their response formats?
