# MetaMapper Database Population and Testing Report

**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Author**: Assistant

## Overview

Successfully populated and tested the MetaMapper database configuration system. The database contains 14 mapping resources, multiple mapping paths, and supports protein and metabolite mapping configurations.

## Database Population

### Script Execution
- **Script**: `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`
- **Location**: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/metamapper.db`
- **Result**: Successfully created and populated database with standard configuration data

### Populated Data
- **Ontologies**: 8 (UniProtKB AC, Arivale Protein ID, Gene Name, Ensembl Protein/Gene, PubChem, ChEBI, KEGG)
- **Properties**: 9 primary properties for different identifier types
- **Endpoints**: 5 (MetabolitesCSV, SPOKE, UKBB_Protein, Arivale_Protein, Arivale_Chemistry)
- **Mapping Resources**: 14 including:
  - UniProt Name Search
  - UMLS Metathesaurus
  - UniChem
  - Arivale lookup services (direct and reverse)
  - UniProt ID Mapping services
  - UniProt Historical Resolver
- **Mapping Paths**: Multiple paths for protein and metabolite mapping
- **Ontology Coverage**: Defined for all mapping resources

## CLI Testing Results

### Commands Tested

1. **List Resources**
   ```bash
   biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db resources list
   ```
   - Successfully listed all 14 mapping resources
   - Detailed view shows ontology coverage and path usage

2. **Find Mapping Paths**
   ```bash
   biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db paths find --from UNIPROTKB_AC --to ARIVALE_PROTEIN_ID
   ```
   - Found 2 paths:
     - Direct lookup (Priority 1)
     - Historical resolution + lookup (Priority 2)

3. **Validate Clients**
   ```bash
   biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db validate clients
   ```
   - All 7 client classes validated successfully
   - All imports work correctly

4. **Show Resource Details**
   ```bash
   biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db resources show UniProt_NameSearch
   ```
   - Displays comprehensive resource information
   - Shows ontology coverage, mapping paths, and extraction configs

### Key Features Verified

1. **Database Connection**: Works correctly with environment variable override
2. **Resource Management**: Can list, filter, and inspect mapping resources
3. **Path Finding**: Successfully identifies mapping paths between ontology types
4. **Client Validation**: Verifies all client classes are importable
5. **JSON Output**: Supports structured output for programmatic use

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

1. **Database Path Issue**
   - **Problem**: Default metamapper_db_url pointed to `/home/ubuntu/data/metamapper.db`
   - **Resolution**: Use environment variable `METAMAPPER_DB_URL` to override
   - **Note**: Should be run with Poetry to ensure proper environment

2. **Poetry Environment**
   - **Important**: Must use `poetry run` to ensure correct dependencies and paths
   - **Example**: `poetry run python -m biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db ...`

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Set environment variable for correct DB path
export METAMAPPER_DB_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:////home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/metamapper.db"

# List all resources
poetry run python -m biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db resources list

# Find mapping paths
poetry run python -m biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db paths find --from GENE_NAME --to UNIPROTKB_AC

# Validate all client implementations
poetry run python -m biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db validate clients

# Get JSON output for automation
poetry run python -m biomapper.cli.main metamapper-db resources list --json
```

## Conclusion

The MetaMapper database and CLI tool are fully functional. The system provides:
- Comprehensive configuration management for mapping resources
- Path discovery for identifier mapping
- Validation capabilities for client implementations
- Support for both human-readable and JSON outputs

The tool successfully manages the complex mapping configurations required for the Biomapper project with no overlap with PubChem embedding work.
