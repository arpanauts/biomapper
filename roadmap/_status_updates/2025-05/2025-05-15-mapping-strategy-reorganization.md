# Biomapper Status Update: Mapping Strategy Reorganization & Project Planning (May 15, 2025)

This document provides an update on the Biomapper project, incorporating our recent work on pipeline evaluation, roadmap reorganization, and future planning priorities.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Roadmap Directory Restructuring:**
    *   Implemented a new staged development workflow with organized directories (`0_backlog/`, `1_planning/`, `2_inprogress/`, `3_completed/`, `4_archived/`)
    *   Created supporting folders (`_reference/`, `_templates/`) with appropriate template files and documentation
    *   Developed comprehensive guide (`HOW_TO_UPDATE_ROADMAP_STAGES.md`) for maintaining the new workflow
    *   Updated main `README.md` to reflect the new project management approach
    *   Consolidated reference materials by moving `api/`, `architecture/`, `enhanced_mappers/`, and `ui/` into `_reference/`

*   **Integrated Mapping Pipeline Development & Execution:**
    *   Successfully developed and executed end-to-end mapping solution encompassing:
        *   Phase 1: Forward mapping (UKBB → Arivale)
        *   Phase 2: Reverse mapping (Arivale → UKBB)
        *   Phase 3: Bidirectional reconciliation
    *   Implemented key features including:
        *   One-to-many relationship handling
        *   Dynamic column naming
        *   Canonical mapping selection

*   **Technical Improvements:**
    *   Fixed `IndentationError` in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`, making the executor available for complex mapping tasks
    *   Resolved previous `KeyError` issues with dynamic column name handling
    *   Established comprehensive output generation with structured TSV files and JSON metadata
    *   Completed initial fixes for one-to-many relationship handling in the Phase 1 mapping script (`map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`)

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The project has made significant progress on two fronts:
    1. **Technical Infrastructure:** The integrated mapping pipeline demonstrates end-to-end processing capability, though with a low initial success rate that has since been improved.
    2. **Project Management:** The new roadmap structure provides a clearer framework for tracking feature development from conception to completion.

*   **Component Status:**
    *   **Integrated Mapping Pipeline:** Functional central component that has evolved from direct mapping to more sophisticated approaches.
    *   **MappingExecutor:** Critical component for advanced mapping features; now fully operational with indentation error fixed.
    *   **Mapping Clients:** (e.g., `UniProtNameClient`, `ArivaleLookupClient`) Remain important, especially for use by `MappingExecutor`.
    *   **Reporting/Output:** Established pattern for rich, multi-file output with detailed metadata.

*   **Key Statistics & Metrics:**
    *   Initial pipeline runs showed very low mapping success rate (0.2% - 0.5%), which has been a focus area for improvement.
    *   Output files are now generated in a standardized format in timestamp-based directories (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/output/full_run_20250512_170659/`).

*   **Known Issues:**
    *   **One-to-Many Flag Bug:** Discovered an issue where the `is_one_to_many_target` flag is incorrectly set to TRUE for all records in the Phase 3 reconciliation output. While this affects some metadata tracking and reporting aspects, the core mapping functionality is working correctly. This issue has been documented for future resolution after completing the higher-priority metabolite mapping work.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Mapping Strategy Iterations:**
    *   Confirmed through testing that direct mapping approaches yield very low success rates for the UKBB-Arivale datasets.
    *   The `iterative_mapping_strategy.md` specification remains the foundational approach for comprehensive mapping.
    *   `MappingExecutor` with its iterative logic, secondary ID conversion, and multi-step path finding is essential for acceptable mapping success rates.

*   **Data Processing Pipeline Architecture:**
    *   The new pipeline establishes a clear pattern with distinct phases (forward mapping, reverse mapping, reconciliation) while maintaining flexibility for column naming and data flow.
    *   Structured output generation with multiple files (results TSVs, metadata JSON, logs) provides comprehensive documentation of each run.
    *   Pipeline now appropriately handles one-to-many relationships in both directions with canonical mapping selection.

*   **Project Organization Strategy:**
    *   Adopted a staged development workflow inspired by agile methodologies, with clear gates between backlog, planning, implementation, and completion.
    *   Template-driven approach to feature documentation ensures consistency and comprehensive coverage of requirements, specifications, and design decisions.
    *   Status update mechanism feeds into the roadmap stages, providing a continuous flow of information from current work to planned features.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Tasks (Next 1-3 Days):**
    *   Create first set of actual feature files in the `0_backlog/` folder based on current priorities.
    *   Process high-priority items through the stage gates to populate the `1_planning/` directory.
    *   Ensure comprehensive documentation of the improved mapping approach in appropriate technical notes.

*   **Priorities for Coming Week:**
    *   **TOP PRIORITY: Implement UKBB-Arivale Metabolite Mapping:** Develop and execute mapping between:
        *   UKBB metabolites → Arivale metabolites
        *   UKBB metabolites → Arivale clinical lab results
        *   Use the existing three-phase mapping approach (forward mapping, reverse mapping, reconciliation)
        *   Use this process to identify opportunities to generalize mapping across different entity types (proteins, metabolites, etc.)
        *   Focus on getting more mappings complete while leveraging the existing infrastructure
    *   **Follow Iterative Mapping Strategy as Central Guide:** Use `/roadmap/technical_notes/core_mapping_logic/iterative_mapping_strategy.md` as the definitive guide for:
        *   Generalizing the mapping process across different data types
        *   Addressing the added complexity of many-to-many mapping relationships
        *   Establishing consistent metadata approaches for all mapping types
        *   Ensuring mapper implementations follow a coherent philosophical approach
    *   Continue refinement of UniProt client interaction for robust secondary-to-primary ID conversion.
    *   Formalize the comparative analysis between direct mapping vs. `MappingExecutor`-enhanced approaches.
    *   Implement error handling improvements and logging enhancements as identified in pipeline execution.

*   **Deferred Items:**
    *   **Generalized Implementation of metamapper.db:** While valuable for longer-term flexibility, the generalized metamapper database implementation has been deferred to prioritize immediate mapping success rate improvements. This work would involve:
        *   Abstracting the current database schema to support diverse mapping scenarios
        *   Creating a more flexible query interface for heterogeneous data sources
        *   Implementing advanced caching strategies for performance optimization
        *   Developing a standardized API for database interactions

    *   **Generalized Handling of Composite Identifiers:** The current client-specific implementations of composite identifier handling are not scalable or easily maintainable. The long-term goal is to generalize this approach, potentially through:
        *   Configurable pre-processing within the `MappingExecutor`
        *   Dedicated resolver resources in `metamapper.db`
        *   Middleware/decorator patterns for transparent handling

    *   **Fix One-to-Many Target Flag Bug:** The issue where the `is_one_to_many_target` flag is incorrectly set to TRUE for all records in the Phase 3 output has been deprioritized. This affects metadata tracking and reporting but not core mapping functionality. The fix will be addressed after completing the metabolite mapping work.

    *   **Additional Deferred Capabilities:**
        *   Implement `UMLSClient` for broader biomedical concept mapping
        *   Configure `metamapper.db` for metabolite endpoints/paths
        *   Implement metabolite mapping use cases
        *   Integrate RAG component for handling cases where structured mapping fails
        *   Move `PathLogMappingAssociation` to `cache_models.py`
        *   Add schema/logic for tracking alternative/outdated IDs explicitly
        *   Implement a monitoring dashboard for mapping success rates and client performance
        *   Build CLI tooling for easier management of the mapping configuration database

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Future of Original Scripts:** What is the definitive plan for `map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` and the original `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` now that the integrated pipeline exists? Should they be officially deprecated and archived?

*   **UniProt Client Capabilities:** Does the current UniProt client infrastructure robustly handle all necessary conversions (Gene Name → UniProt, ENSEMBL → UniProt)? What are its limitations regarding historical/secondary IDs?

*   **Refinement of Output Columns:** Do the columns generated by the pipeline fully meet the requirements in `iterative_mapping_strategy.md` for `source_*`, `target_*`, and `mapping_path_details`?

*   **Orchestration Model:** How will the pipeline script and `MappingExecutor` continue to evolve in their interactions? Will the pipeline become a high-level orchestrator that configures and runs `MappingExecutor` for different phases/strategies?

*   **Testing Strategy:** What is the optimal testing approach for the integrated pipeline, particularly for scenarios involving `MappingExecutor`'s advanced features?

This status update highlights both technical progress with the mapping pipeline and organizational improvements with the new roadmap structure, providing a solid foundation for continued development.
