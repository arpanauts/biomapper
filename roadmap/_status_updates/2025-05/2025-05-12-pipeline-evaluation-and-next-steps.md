# Biomapper Status Update: Integrated Pipeline Evaluation & Next Steps (May 12, 2025)

This document provides a comprehensive status update for the Biomapper project. It reflects recent accomplishments, including the development of an integrated mapping pipeline, the current project state, technical context, and planned next steps. This update augments the previous status from May 8, 2025.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Integrated Mapping Pipeline Developed & Executed (via Claude):**
    *   A new script (referred to as `run_mapping_pipeline.py` in Claude's summary) was developed and successfully executed. This script provides an end-to-end mapping solution, encompassing:
        *   Phase 1: Forward mapping (UKBB → Arivale)
        *   Phase 2: Reverse mapping (Arivale → UKBB)
        *   Phase 3: Bidirectional reconciliation
    *   This new pipeline implements key concepts from the original `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` but with a more integrated approach.
*   **Dynamic Column Name Handling:** The new pipeline and underlying logic now correctly handle dynamic column names passed via arguments, resolving previous `KeyError` issues.
*   **Comprehensive Output Generation:** The pipeline successfully generated a suite of output files in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/output/full_run_20250512_170659/`:
    *   `phase1_forward_mapping_results.tsv`
    *   `phase2_reverse_mapping_results.tsv`
    *   `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation_results.tsv` (with validation status, one-to-many flags, canonical mappings)
    *   `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation_metadata.json` (summary statistics)
    *   `pipeline_log.txt`
*   **Demonstration of Key Mapping Features:** The new pipeline successfully demonstrated:
    *   One-to-many relationship handling.
    *   Dynamic column naming.
    *   Canonical mapping selection.
*   **Clarification of True MVP Requirements (from May 8):** Confirmed that the MVP must implement the full `iterative_mapping_strategy.md`. The new pipeline is a significant step towards or an initial version of this.
*   **`MappingExecutor` IndentationError Fixed (from checkpoint):** A previously reported `IndentationError` in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` was resolved, making the executor available for more complex mapping tasks.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The project has made a significant leap with the introduction of the integrated mapping pipeline. While this pipeline is functional and demonstrates end-to-end processing, it has a **very low mapping success rate (0.2% - 0.5%)**. The immediate focus shifts to investigating this low success rate and strategizing on how to improve it, likely by incorporating the more advanced features of the `MappingExecutor`.
*   **Component Status:**
    *   **NEW: Integrated Mapping Pipeline Script (e.g., `run_mapping_pipeline.py`):** This is now a central, functional component. Its current "direct mapping" approach, however, yields low success.
    *   `map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` and `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`: The roles of these individual scripts are likely superseded by the new integrated pipeline. The problem targeted by refactoring `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` (dynamic column handling) has been addressed within the new pipeline.
    *   `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: With its `IndentationError` fixed, this remains a critical component. Its iterative logic, secondary ID conversion capabilities, and multi-step path finding are essential for improving mapping success.
    *   Mapping Clients (e.g., `UniProtNameClient`, `ArivaleLookupClient`): Remain important, especially for use by `MappingExecutor`.
    *   Reporting/Output: The new pipeline establishes a good pattern for rich, multi-file output.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
    1.  **Critically Low Mapping Success Rate (0.2% - 0.5%):** The most pressing issue. The new pipeline mapped only 6 proteins in each direction.
    2.  **Leveraging Advanced Mapping Logic:** The current "direct mapping" approach of the new pipeline is insufficient. The full iterative strategy (secondary ID conversions, multi-step paths using `MappingExecutor`) needs to be implemented or integrated to improve results.
    3.  **UniProt ID Conversion Complexity:** Effective mapping of secondary IDs (gene names, ENSEMBL IDs) to primary UniProt ACs remains a key challenge.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architectural Decisions:**
    *   **Integrated Pipeline Approach:** A shift towards a single, orchestrating script for the end-to-end mapping process (forward, reverse, reconcile) has been demonstrated.
    *   **Adherence to `iterative_mapping_strategy.md`:** This remains the blueprint. The new pipeline is an initial step; deeper alignment with the strategy's advanced features is needed.
*   **Key Data Structures, Algorithms, or Patterns:**
    *   The new pipeline utilizes a "direct mapping approach" (details to be fully understood). This contrasts with `MappingExecutor`'s more complex iterative approach.
    *   Established pattern for generating structured TSV outputs and a JSON metadata summary.
*   **Learnings:**
    *   Direct mapping approaches, while simpler to implement, yield very low success rates for the UKBB-Arivale datasets.
    *   Conflicts in bidirectional validation can arise from ID format differences (as noted in the new pipeline's output: 6 forward mappings classified as conflicts). This needs further investigation.
    *   The necessity of robust secondary ID to primary UniProt AC conversion is re-emphasized by the low success rates.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Tasks (Next 1-3 Days):**
    1.  **Deep Dive Analysis of Low Mapping Success:**
        *   Examine the exact "direct mapping" logic within the new pipeline script.
        *   Investigate the 6 "conflicts" to understand the ID format issues.
        *   Review input data (`UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv`, Arivale proteomics metadata) for characteristics that might contribute to low matching (e.g., ID types, coverage).
        *   Consider UniProt ID versioning issues (primary vs. secondary/historical accessions).
    2.  **Plan `MappingExecutor` Integration/Enhancement:**
        *   Strategize how to incorporate `MappingExecutor`'s iterative mapping capabilities (secondary ID lookups, multi-step paths) into the mapping process to improve success rates. This may involve using the `MappingExecutor` as the core engine called by the new pipeline script.
*   **Priorities for Coming Week:**
    1.  Implement initial enhancements to the mapping logic based on the low-success analysis (e.g., attempting a simple secondary ID lookup path using `MappingExecutor`).
    2.  Refine UniProt client interaction for robust secondary-to-primary ID conversion.
    3.  Begin comparative runs between the new pipeline's "direct approach" and an enhanced approach using `MappingExecutor`.
*   **Potential Challenges:**
    *   Complexity of accurately mapping various secondary identifiers to current primary UniProt ACs.
    *   Ensuring data integrity and correct provenance tracking through more complex mapping paths.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Nature of New Pipeline's "Direct Mapping":** What specific fields and logic does the new integrated pipeline use for its current "direct mapping"?
*   **Future of Original Scripts:** What is the plan for `map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` and the original `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py` now that the integrated pipeline exists? Are they deprecated?
*   **UniProt Client Capabilities:** Does the current UniProt client infrastructure robustly handle necessary conversions (Gene Name -> UniProt, ENSEMBL -> UniProt)? What are its limitations regarding historical/secondary IDs? (Memory `e6278ce7-18d9-4677-ada7-2910782148c7` suggests limitations).
*   **Refinement of Output Columns:** Review the columns generated by the new pipeline. Are they fully comprehensive as per the `iterative_mapping_strategy.md`'s implicit requirements for `source_*`, `target_*`, `mapping_path_details`?
*   **Orchestration Model:** How will the new pipeline script and `MappingExecutor` interoperate? Will the pipeline script become a high-level orchestrator that configures and runs `MappingExecutor` for different phases/strategies?
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Review and enhance error handling and logging in the new integrated pipeline, especially as more complex logic from `MappingExecutor` is incorporated.
*   **Configuration Management:** How are parameters for the new pipeline (input paths, API keys, specific mapping strategies) managed? Leverage the existing Pydantic-settings `Config` system.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** How should confidence scores be assigned and propagated in a more complex iterative mapping process involving `MappingExecutor`?
*   **Testing Strategy:** Develop a testing strategy for the integrated pipeline and for scenarios involving `MappingExecutor`'s advanced features. This includes unit tests for new logic and integration tests for pipeline runs.
*   **Dual-Agent Coordination:** As development continues, ensure clear task division (e.g., `MappingExecutor` enhancements vs. pipeline orchestration, client improvements vs. data analysis).

This status update highlights significant progress with the new pipeline while clearly identifying the critical next step: addressing the low mapping success rate by integrating more sophisticated mapping logic.
