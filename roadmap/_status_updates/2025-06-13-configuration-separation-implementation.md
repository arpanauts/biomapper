# Status Update: Configuration Separation and Pipeline Enhancement

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Implemented Configuration Separation for Mapping Strategies:**
  - Successfully separated mapping strategies from entity configuration files into a centralized `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml`
  - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py` to detect and handle both entity configs and strategies configs based on `config_type` field
  - Created validation utility `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/setup_and_configuration/validate_config_separation.py` to check for duplicate strategy names and proper separation
  - Maintained backward compatibility - system warns if strategies found in entity configs but continues to function

- **Enhanced Documentation System:**
  - Created comprehensive action types reference at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/ACTION_TYPES_REFERENCE.md` documenting all available action types for mapping strategies
  - Created migration guide at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for moving strategies to new structure
  - Created config type field reference at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/docs/CONFIG_TYPE_FIELD_REFERENCE.md` explaining the new configuration detection system
  - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/README.md` with new configuration structure information
  - Created quick reference guide at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/CONFIGURATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for easy lookup

- **Fixed Script Configuration Loading:**
  - Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` to properly load configuration from metamapper.db instead of hardcoded paths
  - Fixed column name extraction from PropertyExtractionConfig by parsing JSON in extraction_pattern field
  - Fixed connection_details parsing by adding JSON deserialization for database endpoints
  - Successfully tested full pipeline execution with 487 proteins mapped from UKBB to HPA

- **JSON Schema Simplification:**
  - Simplified `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/schemas/protein_config_schema.json` from complex nested definitions to basic validation
  - Focused on practical validation (catching typos and structural errors) rather than over-engineering
  - Maintained all necessary fields while removing advanced JSON schema features

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall:** The biomapper project has successfully transitioned to a cleaner configuration architecture with separated concerns. Entity configurations focus on data sources and ontologies, while mapping strategies are centralized for better reusability and maintenance.

- **Configuration System:**
  - Entity configs define: ontologies, databases/endpoints, mapping paths, and resources
  - Strategies config defines: generic strategies (reusable across entities) and entity-specific strategies
  - `populate_metamapper_db.py` processes entity configs first, then strategies to handle dependencies
  - Database successfully populated with 16 ontologies, 7 endpoints, 13 mapping paths, 8 strategies (3 generic, 5 entity-specific)

- **Pipeline Status:**
  - UKBB-HPA protein mapping pipeline fully functional with configuration-driven approach
  - All 4 strategy steps (CONVERT → RESOLVE → FILTER → CONVERT) execute correctly
  - Results match expected behavior: 487 mapped, 2436 filtered out

- **Outstanding Issues:**
  - Jupyter notebook at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/notebooks/2_use_cases/ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb` still needs updating for async functions
  - One test configuration file (`test_optional_steps_config.yaml`) still contains mapping_strategies section (acceptable for testing)

## 3. Technical Context

- **Config Type Detection:**
  - Files with `config_type: "mapping_strategies"` are processed as strategies configurations
  - Files without config_type field are implicitly entity configurations
  - Different validation rules apply based on config type

- **Strategy Organization:**
  ```yaml
  generic_strategies:      # Reusable across all entity types
    BRIDGE_VIA_COMMON_ID:  # Uses parameters for flexibility
  entity_strategies:       # Entity-specific complex pipelines
    protein:
      UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE:  # 4-step pipeline
  ```

- **Database Schema Updates:**
  - `mapping_strategies` table stores strategy definitions with entity_type field
  - `mapping_strategy_steps` table maintains step order and action parameters
  - Generic strategies use entity_type='generic' for cross-entity reuse

- **Script Configuration Loading:**
  - Scripts query metamapper.db for all configuration instead of hardcoding
  - Column names extracted from PropertyExtractionConfig.extraction_pattern JSON
  - File paths support environment variable substitution (${DATA_DIR})

## 4. Next Steps

- **Update Jupyter Notebook (High Priority):**
  - Modify `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/notebooks/2_use_cases/ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb` to handle async functions
  - Update to use configuration-driven approach via metamapper.db
  - Add progress reporting and error handling

- **Document Configuration Architecture:**
  - Create architecture diagram showing relationship between configs, database, and execution
  - Document best practices for creating new strategies
  - Add examples of generic vs entity-specific strategy design

- **Validate Other Pipelines:**
  - Test QIN OSP and Arivale protein pipelines with new configuration structure
  - Ensure all pipelines use configuration-driven approach
  - Apply same script fixes if needed

- **Enhance Strategy Capabilities:**
  - Implement additional action types (TRANSFORM_IDENTIFIERS, MERGE_IDENTIFIER_SETS)
  - Add parameter validation for strategy definitions
  - Consider strategy composition features for building complex pipelines from simpler ones

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **Strategy Reusability:** How can we make entity-specific strategies more generic? For example, UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE could potentially be parameterized to work for any UniProt-bridged datasets.

- **Performance Optimization:** With strategies now centralized, we could implement strategy caching or pre-compilation for frequently used pipelines.

- **Version Control:** Should strategies have version numbers to track changes over time? This would help with reproducibility and debugging.

- **Testing Framework:** Need a systematic way to test strategies independently of full pipeline execution. Consider creating a strategy test harness.

- **Migration Timeline:** When should we enforce strict separation and remove backward compatibility for strategies in entity configs?
