# Biomapper Status Update: UniChem Implementation & Validation Fixes (May 16, 2025)

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

* **Bug Fixes:**
  * Fixed the `is_one_to_many_target` flag bug in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`
    * The issue was incorrectly setting the flag to TRUE for all records in the output
    * Updated logic to preserve existing flag values when already set to avoid overwriting
    * This ensures the flag is only set when a source maps to multiple targets OR a target is mapped by multiple sources
    * Improves canonical mapping selection reliability

* **Terminology Standardization:**
  * Updated validation terminology from "UnidirectionalSuccess" to "Successful" throughout the codebase
  * Modified all instances in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`
  * Changed log message formats to use consistent terminology
  * Aligned code with documentation standards defined in planning documents

* **UniChem Client Implementation:**
  * Developed a fully-functional `UniChemClient` in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/unichem_client.py`
  * Implemented proper `BaseMappingClient` interface for integration with `MappingExecutor`
  * Added support for mapping between 20+ chemical database systems (PubChem, ChEBI, HMDB, KEGG, etc.)
  * Implemented async methods with proper caching and retry logic for efficient API communication
  * Added bidirectional mapping support through the `reverse_map_identifiers` method

* **Comprehensive Testing:**
  * Created unit tests for the `UniChemClient` in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/mapping/clients/test_unichem_client.py`
  * Tests cover initialization, configuration, mapping functionality, error handling, and edge cases
  * Utilized mock responses to simulate API interactions without external dependencies

## 2. Current Project State

* **Overall:** The project is transitioning from protein-focused mapping to a generalized entity mapping framework, with metabolites as the next entity type for implementation.

* **Component Status:**
  * **Phase 3 Bidirectional Reconciliation:** Fixed and ready for use with metabolite mappings
  * **MappingExecutor:** Updated with consistent validation terminology
  * **UniChem Client:** Fully implemented, tested, and ready for use in metabolite mapping scripts
  * **Remaining Metabolite Clients:** `TranslatorNameResolverClient` and `UMLSClient` still need implementation
  * **Metabolite Mapping Scripts:** Design complete, awaiting implementation

* **Key Statistics & Metrics:**
  * Current protein mapping success rate remains at 0.2-0.5%, highlighting the need for improved approaches
  * Initial metabolite mapping is expected to achieve ~30% with primary approach (UniChem), 50%+ with fallbacks

* **Known Issues:**
  * Terminology inconsistencies may still exist in some documentation files and should be updated for consistency
  * No dedicated clients yet for metabolite-specific fallback mechanisms beyond UniChem

## 3. Technical Context

* **UniChem API Integration:**
  * Leveraged the REST API at `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/unichem/rest`
  * Implemented two primary endpoints:
    * `/src_compound_id/{compound_id}/src_id/{src_id}` for normal mapping
    * `/inchikey/{compound_id}` for InChIKey-based searches
  * Added proper retry logic with exponential backoff for API resilience
  * Implemented request chunking to prevent overwhelming the API

* **BaseMappingClient Implementation:**
  * Extended the `BaseMappingClient` abstract base class to ensure consistent interface
  * Incorporated `CachedMappingClientMixin` for efficient memory caching of mapping results
  * Followed the established pattern of `map_identifiers` and `reverse_map_identifiers` methods
  * Ensured return format compatibility with `MappingExecutor`

* **Async HTTP Request Handling:**
  * Used `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests to the UniChem API
  * Implemented proper session management with creation in `_ensure_session` and cleanup in `close`
  * Added concurrency support through `asyncio.gather` for parallel processing of identifier chunks

* **Bidirectional Validation Enhancements:**
  * The fix for `is_one_to_many_target` now correctly identifies:
    * When a target is mapped by multiple sources (setting `one_to_many_source_col`)
    * When a source maps to multiple targets (setting `one_to_many_target_col`)
  * This enables proper prioritization in canonical mapping selection

## 4. Next Steps

* **Priorities for Coming Week:**
  * **Complete Metabolite Client Development:**
    * Implement `TranslatorNameResolverClient` for name resolution
    * Implement `UMLSClient` for concept mapping (DEFERRED - see Longer-Term Tasks)
    * Create unit tests for each client

  * **Develop Metabolite Mapping Scripts:**
    * Create `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_metabolites_to_arivale_metabolites.py`
    * Create `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_metabolites_to_arivale_clinlabs.py`
    * Incorporate the newly developed clients into these scripts

  * **Begin RAG Approach Development:**
    * Start implementation of `RAGMappingClient`.
    * Investigate and set up Qdrant/FastEmbed for vector database.

  * **Enhance Test Coverage:**
    * Develop integration tests for metabolite mapping end-to-end
    * Test with real metabolite identifiers from various sources

  * **Update Documentation:**
    * Update remaining documentation with consistent validation terminology
    * Document the UniChem integration and usage patterns

* **Longer-Term Tasks:**
  * Design and implement the FallbackOrchestrator class
  * Implement enhanced confidence scoring for metabolites
  * Extend metadata population in `populate_metamapper.db.py` for metabolite support
  * Implement `UMLSClient` for concept mapping (DEFERRED from earlier priorities)

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

* **UniChem API Rate Limits:** Are there any documented or undocumented rate limits for the UniChem API that might affect large-scale mapping operations? The current implementation uses chunking and delay, but we may need to adjust these parameters based on performance in production.

* **InChIKey Normalization:** Should we implement standardized InChIKey normalization to improve mapping success rates? InChIKeys sometimes appear in different formats or with varying prefixes across databases.

* **Composite Identifier Handling:** How should the metabolite mapping handle composite identifiers? The current implementation does not have special handling for composite IDs like we have for gene names in the protein mapping.

* **Confidence Score Calibration:** How should we calibrate the multi-factor confidence scores for metabolites? Will the weights used for proteins be appropriate, or do we need entity-specific tuning?

* **Cache Persistence:** Would it be beneficial to implement persistent caching for UniChem results to reduce API calls across runs? This could significantly improve performance for repeated mapping operations.

This status update builds on the previous metabolite mapping strategy planning work while focusing on the implementation of the UniChem client and validation terminology standardization.
