# Resource Metadata System: Endpoint-to-Endpoint Mapping Integration

**Date: April 18, 2025**
**Author: Biomapper Team**

## Summary

This status update details the implementation of the vertical integration between the `relationship_mapping_paths` table in our database and the `mapping_cache` to enable efficient endpoint-to-endpoint mapping, with a specific focus on mapping MetabolitesCSV to SPOKE endpoints.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Path Discovery and Management**
   - Created `RelationshipPathFinder` class for discovering and managing optimal mapping paths between ontology types
   - Implemented methods to store paths in the `relationship_mapping_paths` table with performance metrics

2. **Mapping Execution**
   - Created `RelationshipMappingExecutor` class for executing discovered mapping paths
   - Implemented multi-step mapping for complex paths (e.g., hmdb → pubchem → chebi)
   - Added caching system to store results in `mapping_cache` for future use

3. **Resource Adapters**
   - Created adapter interfaces for mapping resources
   - Implemented adapters for UniChem and KEGG
   - Added transformations for special cases (e.g., removing "HMDB" prefix for UniChem)

4. **CLI Commands**
   - Added CLI commands for discovering paths and executing mappings
   - Included options for bypassing cache and forcing path rediscovery

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Created a test script to validate the vertical integration
   - Tested path discovery, mapping execution, and cache verification

## Technical Details

### Core Components

1. **RelationshipPathFinder**
   - Discovers mapping paths between ontology types for relationships
   - Stores and retrieves paths from the database
   - Updates performance metrics after mapping execution

2. **RelationshipMappingExecutor**
   - Executes discovered mapping paths
   - Handles single-step and multi-step mappings
   - Manages caching of results

3. **StepExecutor and ResourceAdapter**
   - Provides a standardized interface for executing mapping steps
   - Adapters implement specific mapping logic for different resources

### Database Integration

The implementation connects the following tables:
- `mapping_paths`: Stores paths between ontology types
- `relationship_mapping_paths`: Links relationships to mapping paths
- `mapping_cache`: Caches mapping results
- `relationship_mappings`: Links relationships to cached mappings

### Example Mapping Flow

For mapping a MetabolitesCSV value to SPOKE:
1. Extract an HMDB ID from MetabolitesCSV
2. Map HMDB ID to PubChem ID using UniChem
3. Map PubChem ID to CHEBI ID using another resource
4. Use CHEBI ID to find SPOKE entity
5. Cache the result for future use

## Next Steps

1. **Endpoint Extraction Logic**
   - Implement property extraction from endpoint values
   - Link extraction with mapping execution

2. **Advanced Path Discovery**
   - Add graph-based path discovery algorithms
   - Optimize path selection based on performance history

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add detailed performance metrics collection
   - Implement automatic path optimization

4. **Resource Management**
   - Add more resource adapters (PubChem, CHEBI, etc.)
   - Implement resource failover mechanisms

5. **Batch Processing**
   - Add batch mapping for multiple values
   - Optimize for parallel execution

## Conclusion

The implemented vertical integration provides a solid foundation for endpoint-to-endpoint mapping in Biomapper. The system enables the discovery of optimal mapping paths and efficiently executes them while maintaining a cache of results for improved performance. This infrastructure will be essential for scaling our mapping capabilities across different data sources and ontologies.
