# Development Status Update - June 18, 2025

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Resolved Cascading Import Errors:** Systematically debugged a series of `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions that arose from recent major refactoring. This included:
    - Correcting the import for `PathExecutionStatus` from the now-defunct `biomapper.types` module to its new location in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/db/cache_models.py`.
    - Identifying that the entire `biomapper.utils` module was removed and preparing a fix for `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py` to use standard Python libraries (`logging`, `datetime`) instead.
- **Adopted "Prompt-First" Workflow:** Successfully utilized the new development protocol by generating detailed, actionable markdown prompts for delegated agents to execute fixes, rather than modifying code directly. This improves traceability and separates orchestration from implementation.
- **Repository Maintenance:** Cleaned up the local repository by identifying and deleting stale branches (`feature/extract-path-manager`, `feature/extract-strategy-orchestrator`) that had already been merged into `main`.

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall Status:** The project is in a critical debugging phase following a major refactoring of core components. The main pipeline script (`run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`) is simplified but currently non-operational due to the downstream import errors.
- **Blocker:** The primary blocker is the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.utils.logging'` in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py`. A prompt to fix this has been generated, but its execution via the `claude` CLI tool failed due to a command-line option error (`--non-interactive`).
- **Stable vs. Active:** The overall architecture is stabilizing, but the core engine components are in active debugging. The YAML configurations and strategy definitions are considered stable.

## 3. Technical Context

- **Architectural Decision (Standard Libraries):** The custom `biomapper.utils` module has been deprecated and removed. All code should now rely on standard Python libraries for common utilities like logging (`logging`) and time (`datetime`).
- **Development Protocol ("Prompt-First"):** All code modifications are to be orchestrated through the generation of detailed markdown prompts located in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/`. This ensures changes are well-documented, planned, and delegated.
- **Code Reorganization:** Key classes have been relocated. For example, `PathExecutionStatus` is now in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/db/cache_models.py`.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Resolve Final Import Error:** The immediate priority is to apply the fix outlined in the prompt `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-115530-debug-modulenotfound-biomapper-utils.md`. This needs to be done manually or by resolving the `claude` CLI execution issue.
2.  **End-to-End Pipeline Validation:** Once the import error is fixed, execute the main pipeline script `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py` to perform a full end-to-end test and verify that the refactored architecture works as expected.
3.  **Systematic Import Audit:** Given the number of cascading import errors, a systematic audit of the codebase (especially in `biomapper/core/`) is recommended to proactively find and fix any other lingering incorrect import paths.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **CLI Tool Execution:** Why did the `claude --non-interactive` command fail? We need to determine the correct way to run the `claude` tool in a non-interactive shell to ensure the "Prompt-First" workflow can be fully automated.
- **Scope of Refactoring Impact:** Are there other modules besides `path_execution_manager.py` that still reference the removed `biomapper.utils` module? A project-wide search for `biomapper.utils` imports is advisable.
