# Status Update: MappingExecutor Path Priority Fix

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **`MappingExecutor` Path Selection Logic Fixed:** A significant bug in the `MappingExecutor` has been addressed. The executor was previously failing to prioritize mapping paths defined for specific endpoint relationships (like `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` with `priority=1`) over generic, ontology-based paths.
    - A Claude Code instance successfully identified the root cause: `_find_direct_paths` was too broad and didn't consider the `EndpointRelationship`.
    - The fix involved introducing a new method `_find_paths_for_relationship` to specifically query for paths tied to an `EndpointRelationship` and updating `_find_mapping_paths` to use this new method first, falling back to the general search if no relationship-specific paths are found. This ensures `MappingPath.priority` is respected for relationship-specific paths.
    - The changes are reported to be backward compatible.

## 2. Current Project State
- **Overall:** The project is progressing towards enabling reliable gene name-based mappings as a workaround for identity ontology issues. The critical `MappingExecutor` bug that prevented this for HPA seems to be resolved, pending testing.
- **`MappingExecutor`:** Now theoretically capable of correctly prioritizing user-defined mapping paths for specific relationships.
- **UKBB-HPA Mapping:** Should now work correctly using the `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` path.
- **UKBB-QIN Mapping:** Was already working and should remain unaffected.
- **Blockers:** The primary known blocker for HPA gene name mapping has been addressed. The next step is rigorous testing.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architectural Decision:** The `MappingExecutor` will now explicitly look for paths defined at the `EndpointRelationship` level first. This makes the `priority` field on `MappingPath` more effective for fine-tuning path selection for specific source-target endpoint pairs.
- **Key Algorithm Change:** `_find_mapping_paths` in `MappingExecutor` now has a two-tiered approach:
    1. Check for paths specific to the `source_endpoint` and `target_endpoint` relationship (ordered by priority).
    2. If none, fall back to the broader ontology-type-based search.
- **Database Models:** The fix leverages `EndpointRelationship` and `RelationshipMappingPath` tables more directly in the initial path discovery phase.

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Test `MappingExecutor` Fix (Critical):**
    *   Run `python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py --drop-all` to ensure a clean database state reflecting all `populate_metamapper_db.py` configurations.
    *   Run `python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` using the small test input file.
        *   Carefully examine logs for confirmation that `UKBB_UniProt_to_HPA_GeneName` is selected.
        *   Verify that output mappings are generated as expected (i.e., gene names for HPA).
    *   Run `python /home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_qin.py` (or equivalent QIN mapping script) to ensure no regressions.
2.  **Full Dataset Test (If small test passes):**
    *   Update `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/map_ukbb_to_hpa.py` and the QIN mapping script to use the full input file: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/UKBB_Protein_Meta_full.tsv` (Column: `UniProt`).
    *   Execute mappings with the full dataset.
    *   Analyze results for success rates and correctness.
3.  **Address `qdrant_client` (If RAG functionality is desired soon):**
    *   The `qdrant_client` import is still commented out in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/src/biomapper/mapping_strategies.py`. If RAG-based mapping is a near-term priority, install the dependency: `poetry add qdrant-client`.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- **Mapping Success Rates:** While the executor logic is fixed, the overall mapping success rate for gene names still needs to be evaluated, especially with the full dataset. Issues like malformed gene names or mismatches in data sources (MEMORY[140ad7b0-e133-4771-a738-07e4b4926be6]) might still persist.
- **Iterative Mapping:** The current fix focuses on single-path selection. Further work on `MappingExecutor` might involve more complex iterative strategies if direct gene name mapping isn't sufficient.
