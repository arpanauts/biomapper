# Development Status Update - June 25, 2025

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Resolved All Test Suite Warnings:** Successfully eliminated all `RuntimeWarning`s related to un-awaited asynchronous `close()` calls in the test suite. This was achieved by updating `tearDown` methods in `tests/cache/test_cached_mapper.py` and `tests/cache/test_manager.py` to use `asyncio.run()`, ensuring proper cleanup of async resources.
- **Achieved Stable Test Suite:** The entire test suite now passes cleanly with **1114 passed tests**, providing a stable and reliable foundation for the core library.
- **Attempted End-to-End Pipeline Validation:** Initiated a full pipeline run using `scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`. This effort successfully identified the next critical blocker: the API server failing to start.

## 2. Current Project State

- **CRITICAL BLOCKER - API Server Startup Failure:** The project is currently blocked by a fatal error preventing the `biomapper-api` from starting. The `uvicorn` server exits immediately with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.api'`. The application cannot be tested or used until this is resolved.
- **Core Library (Stable):** The core `biomapper` library is in a very stable state, underscored by the comprehensive and passing test suite.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (Blocked):** While the project has been architecturally separated into a client, API, and core library, the integration is incomplete and blocked by the API startup failure.
- **`biomapper-ui` (Blocked - Rebuild Required):** The UI remains non-functional due to a missing `package.json`. As documented in the `2025-06-24-184500-ui-investigation-report.md`, a full rebuild is required.

## 3. Technical Context

- **API Startup Error:** The `ModuleNotFoundError` when running `uvicorn biomapper.api.main:app` suggests a fundamental issue with the Python path or how the application is structured and installed in the Poetry environment. The `uvicorn` process cannot find the `biomapper.api` module, even though it is being run from the project root. This likely points to an issue in `pyproject.toml` or the project's directory structure.
- **Async Resource Management:** The pattern of using `asyncio.run(self.db_manager.close())` in synchronous `unittest.TestCase.tearDown` methods has been established as the correct way to manage async resource cleanup in our test suite.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Diagnose and Fix API Startup (Highest Priority):**
    - **Action:** Investigate the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'biomapper.api'`.
    - **Goal:** Get the `biomapper-api` server running successfully. This will likely involve inspecting `pyproject.toml`, verifying the directory structure (`ls -R biomapper/`), and ensuring Poetry is installing the packages correctly.
2.  **Validate End-to-End Pipeline:**
    - **Action:** Once the API is running, execute `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`.
    - **Goal:** Confirm that the client, API, and core library can communicate and execute a strategy successfully.
3.  **Begin UI Rebuild:**
    - **Action:** Follow the plan in `roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-24-184500-ui-investigation-report.md` to initialize a new Vite/React project.
    - **Goal:** Create a stable foundation for the new user interface.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **Project Structure:** Is the `api` directory correctly configured as a Python module within the `biomapper` project? The `ModuleNotFoundError` suggests it is not being recognized.
