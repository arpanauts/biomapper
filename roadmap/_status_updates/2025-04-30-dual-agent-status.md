# Biomapper Status Update: 2025-04-30 - Dual-Agent Coordination & Next Steps

This document provides a comprehensive status update for the Biomapper project, reflecting recent progress, the current state, technical context, and the planned next steps for the dual-agent (Claude & Cascade) development approach.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implemented specific exception classes (`ClientExecutionError`, `ClientInitializationError`, `CacheTransactionError`, `CacheRetrievalError`) in `biomapper/core/exceptions.py` and integrated them into `MappingExecutor` for more granular error reporting during client and cache operations.
*   **Cache Database Schema Enhancement:** Added new metadata fields (`confidence_score`, `mapping_path_details`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction`) to the `EntityMapping` model (`biomapper/db/cache_models.py`) to capture richer mapping provenance.
*   **Database Migration:** Successfully generated and applied the Alembic migration to add the new metadata columns to the `entity_mappings` table in `mapping_cache.db` (Claude).
*   **Reporting Script Enhancement (`map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`):**
    *   Refactored the script to query the `EntityMapping` table in the cache DB (`mapping_cache.db`) instead of `PathLogMappingAssociation` to retrieve the enhanced metadata.
    *   Modified the script to merge the retrieved metadata (confidence, path details, hop count, direction) into the final results DataFrame (`final_df`) for comprehensive output.
    *   **Confirmed:** Script correctly retrieves and includes new metadata fields in the output CSV when those fields are populated in the database (tested manually by Claude).
*   **MappingExecutor Fixes (from `2025-04-30-current-status.md`):**
    *   Ensured reliable creation of cache DB tables (`EntityMapping`, `PathExecutionLog`, etc.) upon `MappingExecutor` initialization.
*   **Dual-Agent Coordination Setup:** Established a working model where the USER coordinates tasks between Claude (focused on core executor logic, DB migrations, metadata population) and Cascade (focused on reporting, metadata consumption).

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The project has successfully executed a basic UKBB Protein -> Arivale Protein mapping (`map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`) and laid the groundwork for enhanced metadata tracking and reporting. The core `MappingExecutor` is partially functional for this specific path but requires significant refactoring (led by Claude) to become fully dynamic and configuration-driven based on `metamapper.db`.
*   **Component Status:**
    *   `db/models.py` (Metamapper Config): Stable.
    *   `db/cache_models.py` (Cache Schema): Updated with new fields; Alembic migration **applied successfully** (Claude).
    *   `mapping_cache.db`: Functional, populated with basic UKBB->Arivale results; schema updated.
    *   `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`: Sufficient for current protein framework focus.
    *   `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: **Partially refactored/functional.** Basic execution and caching work for the protein path. Error handling improved. **Metadata population in `_cache_results` requires implementation and testing (Claude).** Major refactoring for dynamic, config-driven execution is the primary outstanding task (Claude).
    *   `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`: **Actively being enhanced (Cascade/USER).** Logic updated to query and integrate new metadata fields; confirmed to retrieve populated fields correctly.
    *   `mapping/clients/`: `UniProtNameClient` stable. Other clients assessed but not modified recently.
    *   `biomapper/core/exceptions.py`: Updated with new specific exceptions.
*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
    1.  **Metadata Population Implementation/Testing:** The immediate blocker is that Claude needs to fully implement and test the logic within `MappingExecutor._cache_results` to correctly calculate and store the new metadata fields (`confidence_score`, `mapping_path_details`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction`) during runtime mapping.
    2.  **MappingExecutor Refactoring:** The main long-term blocker remains the need for Claude to refactor `MappingExecutor` to implement dynamic path finding, client execution, etc., based on `metamapper.db` configuration (as detailed in `2025-04-25-ukbb-arivale-mvp-roadmap.md`).
    3.  **Metadata Population:** Logic for calculating/populating `confidence_score`, `mapping_path_details`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction` needs to be implemented in `MappingExecutor` (Claude).

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Architecture:** Endpoint-relationship-resource model (`metamapper.db`) driving a dynamic `MappingExecutor`. Results and provenance cached (`mapping_cache.db`). Mapping direction currently UKBB -> Arivale.
*   **Dual-Agent Workflow:** USER coordinates tasks between Claude (core logic) and Cascade (reporting/consumption), ensuring communication and minimizing conflicts.
*   **Data Structures/Patterns:** SQLAlchemy (Core & asyncio for cache), Alembic for cache migrations, Pandas for script data handling, specific custom exceptions for error handling, `EntityMapping` model extended for richer metadata.
*   **Key Learnings:**
    *   Importance of consistent return types from `MappingExecutor` (fixed).
    *   Need for robust cache DB initialization (fixed).
    *   Clear separation of concerns between core mapping logic/metadata generation (Claude) and result consumption/reporting (Cascade) is crucial.
    *   USER coordination is essential for managing dependencies (e.g., Cascade needs Claude to populate metadata before reporting script can be fully tested).

## 4. Next Steps (Split Roadmap)

**Claude's Track (Core Execution & Metadata Population):**

1.  **Implement & Test Metadata Population (`MappingExecutor._cache_results`) (Highest Priority):**
    *   Finalize and test the logic to calculate/determine initial values for `confidence_score`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction`, and `mapping_path_details` (as JSON, including path ID, log ID).
    *   Ensure these values are correctly stored in the `EntityMapping` table when caching new mapping results.
    *   **Confirm success with USER by running a mapping and showing populated metadata.**
2.  **Refactor `MappingExecutor` (Core Task - Phased Approach from Roadmap):**
    *   **Phase 1: Bidirectional Mapping:** Implement reverse path finding/execution, enhance metadata tracking.
    *   **Phase 2: Multi-Strategy Mapping:** Implement alternative path logic, ID normalization support.
    *   **(Future/Deferred):** Implement `UMLSClient`, configure metabolite paths, integrate RAG.
3.  **Address Technical Debt:** Fix `NULL` constraint in `PathExecutionLog`, move `PathLogMappingAssociation` to `cache_models.py` (if still relevant after refactor).

**Cascade's Track (Reporting & Metadata Consumption):**

1.  **Finalize Reporting Script (`map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`) (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Verify Recent USER Changes:** Confirm the logic added in Steps 812/813 correctly queries `EntityMapping` and merges *all* new metadata columns (`confidence_score`, `mapping_path_details` fields like `path_id`/`path_log_id`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction`) into the `final_df`.
    *   **Test Metadata Integration:** **PENDING** Claude's completion of metadata population (Step 1 above). Once confirmed, run the script with live mapping results and verify the new columns appear correctly in the output CSV ([ukbb_arivale_comprehensive_mapping.csv](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/ukbb_arivale_comprehensive_mapping.csv:0:0-0:0)). Handle potential `None` values gracefully.
    *   **Review Outer Join Logic:** Ensure the final join between mapping results and source/target metadata is correct and produces the desired comprehensive output format.
2.  **(Future) Generalize Reporting:** Refactor reporting logic into reusable utilities if needed for other mapping pairs.
3.  **(Future) Advanced Reporting:** Add capabilities to filter/analyze results based on new metadata (e.g., confidence thresholds).

### Bidirectional Mapping - Next Steps (Task Split)

With the core implementation complete, the next focus is testing, refinement, and documentation:

*   **Claude:**
    *   Generate comprehensive unit tests in `tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` for the `try_reverse_mapping` functionality, covering various path scenarios (forward only, reverse only, both, none).
    *   Update docstrings in `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` for the `try_reverse_mapping` parameter and related modified methods.
*   **Cascade:**
    *   Execute `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` with `try_reverse_mapping=True`.
    *   Analyze logs and output CSV for correctness, logging clarity, and performance of reverse mappings.
    *   Identify specific mapping clients that would benefit from a dedicated `reverse_map_identifiers` implementation.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

*   How should confidence scores be calculated/defined for different mapping paths/clients? (Claude - during Metadata Population / Executor refactor)
*   Optimal strategy for trying reverse mapping vs. alternative forward paths? (Claude - during Executor refactor)
*   Best way to represent/store multi-step mapping provenance? (Claude - during Executor refactor)
*   How to handle mapping conflicts (multiple paths, different results)? (Claude - during Executor refactor)
*   What is the definitive structure expected within the `mapping_path_details` JSON field? (Claude/Cascade/USER to align)
*   Are `PathLogMappingAssociation` and related logic still needed after the shift to querying `EntityMapping` directly in the reporting script? (Review during/after Claude's refactor).
