# Development Status Update - 2025-04-22

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **Resolved UniChem Connectivity API Integration:** Successfully debugged and corrected the integration logic for the UniChem `/api/v1/connectivity` endpoint used for InChIKey mapping (`biomapper/mapping/resources/clients/unichem_client.py`).
    - Identified that the API returns a dictionary, not a list as initially assumed based on partial documentation.
    - Determined the correct structure of the response dictionary (compound details in `searchedCompound`, source list in top-level `sources`).
    - Updated the Python client code to correctly parse this dictionary structure.
- **Verified UniChem Mapping:** Tested the updated client with the InChIKey for Glucose (`WQZGKKKJIJFFOK-GASJEMHNSA-N`), confirming successful mapping to its ChEBI ID (`CHEBI:17234`).
- **Identified API Limitation:** Discovered that the UniChem connectivity API returns a list of `None` values in the `sources` field when queried with the InChIKey for Water (`XLYOFNOQVPJJNP-UHFFFAOYSA-N`). The client code now gracefully handles this case by returning no match, reflecting the API's current behavior for this specific input.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Improved logging in the test script (`scripts/test_unichem_execution.py`) and temporarily in the UniChem client to facilitate troubleshooting API responses.

## 2. Current Project State
- **Overall Status:** The core mapping functionality, particularly involving the UniChem resource for ontology translation, is significantly more robust after the recent fixes. The project can now execute mapping paths involving InChIKey -> ChEBI translation via UniChem, provided the API supplies the necessary data.
- **Major Components:**
    - `biomapper/mapping/resources/clients/unichem_client.py`: Updated and stable for handling the connectivity API's known response formats.
    - `biomapper/mapping/relationships/executor.py`: Appears stable, correctly invoking the UniChem client as part of path execution.
    - `biomapper/db/models.py`: Schema definitions are stable following earlier updates.
    - `metamapper.db`: Contains the necessary resources and mapping paths (e.g., Path ID 30 for INCHIKEY -> CHEBI) for testing.
- **Stability:** The UniChem client is now stable concerning the connectivity API structure. The core mapping execution seems stable.
- **Outstanding Issues/Blockers:** The primary known limitation is the UniChem API's behavior for specific inputs like the water InChIKey, which is external to our codebase.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architectural Decisions:** The architecture (MEM[f5d191cd]) separating mapping resources (like UniChem) from data endpoints remains central. The UniChem client encapsulates the logic for interacting with its specific API.
- **API Interaction:** The UniChem `/api/v1/connectivity` endpoint requires a `POST` request with the InChIKey in the JSON payload and returns a dictionary containing `searchedCompound` (dict) and `sources` (list).
- **Key Learnings:** External API behavior can differ from documentation or expectations (dictionary vs. list response). Handling specific edge cases or limitations of external APIs (like the water InChIKey issue) is crucial. Direct logging of raw API responses was essential for debugging.
- **Technology Stack:** Python, `aiohttp` (for async HTTP), `SQLAlchemy` (async with SQLite), `python-dotenv`.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Final Testing (Optional):** Could consider testing with a wider variety of InChIKeys to ensure the UniChem client handles different valid responses correctly.
- **Documentation:** Ensure the findings about the UniChem connectivity API's response structure and the water InChIKey limitation are documented within the codebase or project wiki.
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any temporary debugging code or comments if not already done. Ensure logging levels are appropriate for production/general use (e.g., revert temporary `DEBUG` settings if necessary).

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- **UniChem Water Mapping:** Given the connectivity API limitation for water's InChIKey, should alternative methods be explored if water mapping is critical? (e.g., different UniChem endpoints accepting InChI strings, or other mapping resources). This seems like an external API issue for now.
- **General API Robustness:** How resilient is the UniChem client (and potentially other clients) to other unexpected API response variations or errors? Error handling seems present but could be reviewed for comprehensiveness.
