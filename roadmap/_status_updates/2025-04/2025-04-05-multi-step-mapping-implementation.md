# Biomapper Status Update: Multi-Step Mapping Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-05  
**Author:** Cascade AI  
**Focus:** Implementation of multi-step mapping paths for ontological database integration

## 1. Progress Summary

We have successfully implemented a robust multi-step mapping functionality in the Biomapper's MetamappingEngine, enabling:

- **Path-based mapping**: The system can now follow pre-defined multi-step paths (e.g., NAME → CHEBI → INCHI) to map between different ontologies.
- **Property extraction**: A new PropertyExtractor component can extract specific properties from ontological entities.
- **Database persistence**: All mapping attempts are recorded in a SQLite database for performance tracking and future analysis.
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all steps in the mapping process, with detailed metadata capture.

These improvements enable the system to map compound names to various chemistry identifiers like SMILES, molecular formulas, and InChI codes by leveraging external ontological databases.

## 2. Implementation Details

### Key Components Modified/Added:

1. **MetamappingEngine Class** (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/metadata/engine.py`):
   - Fixed execution time tracking in the `lookup_entity` and `search_by_name` methods
   - Implemented `_execute_multi_step_path` method for handling complex mapping paths
   - Added proper handling of ChEBI API client methods for name searches vs. entity lookups

2. **Database Schema** (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/simple_db_init.py`):
   - Created tables for resources, mapping_paths, and path_execution_logs
   - Implemented schema for tracking path execution performance and success rates
   - Added support for storing complex path steps as JSON

3. **Multi-Step Path Setup** (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/setup_multistep_paths_compatible.py`):
   - Defined mappings between various ontologies (NAME → CHEBI → INCHI/SMILES/FORMULA/INCHIKEY)
   - Configured resource access details for each ontology type

4. **Testing Framework** (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/tests/test_multistep_mapping.py`):
   - Implemented tests for various compound mappings (glucose, caffeine, cholesterol)
   - Added database setup for test execution

### Core Algorithms and Data Structures:

1. **Multi-step Mapping Algorithm**:
   ```python
   # Simplified representation of the algorithm
   current_id = entity_id
   current_type = source_type
   
   for step in path_steps:
       # Choose appropriate resource client
       client = get_client(resource_name, step_source)
       
       # Execute step based on method (search_by_name or property extraction)
       if method == "search_by_name":
           results = client.search_by_name(current_id)
           current_entity = results[0]
       elif method == "extract_property":
           property_value = PropertyExtractor.extract_property(
               current_entity, current_type, step_target
           )
           current_entity = property_value
       
       # Update for next step
       current_id = current_entity.id
       current_type = step_target
   ```

2. **Path Execution Log Structure**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE path_execution_logs (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       path_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
       source_id TEXT,
       target_id TEXT,
       confidence REAL,
       execution_time_ms INTEGER,
       result_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
       status TEXT,
       error_message TEXT,
       error_step INTEGER,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   )
   ```

## 3. Lessons Learned

- **ChEBI API Limitations**: The ChEBI database does not consistently provide all property types (INCHI, INCHIKEY) for all compounds. This necessitates robust error handling and fallback strategies.

- **Database Design Considerations**: The SQLite schema must carefully balance between flexibility (storing JSON for path steps) and queryability (having structured fields for key metrics).

- **Error Propagation**: In multi-step processes, it's crucial to track which specific step failed and why, as this information assists in troubleshooting and improving mappings.

- **Timing and Performance**: Proper execution time tracking requires careful placement of timing code in both success and error paths to avoid data loss.

- **Method Selection**: Different entity types require different lookup methods (search_by_name for strings, get_entity_by_id for IDs), and the system must intelligently select the appropriate method based on context.

## 4. Next Steps

- **Expand Ontology Coverage**: Test and integrate additional ontological databases beyond ChEBI (e.g., PubChem, UniProt, KEGG).

- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze execution logs to identify slow mappings and implement caching strategies.

- **Confidence Scoring**: Refine the confidence scoring algorithm to better account for multi-step mapping uncertainty.

- **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel processing for multiple mapping operations to improve throughput.

- **User Interface**: Develop a dashboard for visualizing mapping success rates and performance metrics.

- **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the multi-step mapping functionality.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **Scalability**: How will the system perform with much larger datasets? Are there bottlenecks in the current implementation?

- **Alternative Ontologies**: Which ontological databases should be prioritized for integration after ChEBI?

- **Consistency vs. Coverage**: Should we prioritize having consistent property availability across all compounds, or maximize coverage with available properties?

- **Caching Strategy**: What's the optimal strategy for caching results? Should we implement a time-based invalidation or rely on manual refreshes?

- **Query Optimization**: How can we optimize database queries for retrieving mapping paths when dealing with thousands of entity types?

- **Error Recovery**: Should the system automatically retry failed mappings with alternate paths? How many retries are appropriate?

This status update captures the current state of the multi-step mapping implementation in Biomapper and outlines the path forward for expanding and improving the functionality.
