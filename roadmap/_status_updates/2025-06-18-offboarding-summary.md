# Status Update: 2025-06-18

## 1. Recent Accomplishments
- **Completed `StrategyAction` Dispatch Refactor:** Successfully refactored the `MappingExecutor` to use a dynamic, decorator-based registry pattern. This eliminates the need for manual `if/elif` blocks and makes adding new actions significantly more modular.
- **Centralized Action Registry:** Created a central action registry at `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/registry.py`.
- **Updated All Actions:** Migrated all existing `StrategyAction` classes (`PopulateContextAction`, `ResolveAndMatchForwardAction`, `ResolveAndMatchReverse`, `VisualizeMappingFlowAction`) to use the new `@register_action` decorator.
- **Updated Documentation:** Rewrote the developer guide at `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/action_types/developing_new_action_types.md` to reflect the new, simpler process for creating and integrating actions.

## 2. Current Project State
- **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** The project is currently **non-functional** due to a persistent `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) unable to open database file`.
- **Impact:** This error prevents the database from being created or accessed, blocking the execution of both the database population script (`scripts/setup_and_configuration/populate_metamapper_db.py`) and the main mapping pipeline (`scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`).
- **Status:** The `StrategyAction` refactoring is logically complete but cannot be validated until the database issue is resolved.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architecture:** The core `MappingExecutor` now dynamically dispatches tasks to `StrategyAction` classes via a dictionary lookup, populated at import time by decorators. This is a significant improvement in modularity.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The database error is not a simple configuration issue. After correcting initial pathing and indentation errors in `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/config.py`, the error persists. The root cause is believed to be in the path resolution logic within `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/db/session.py`, which fails to correctly resolve the relative database path and create the `data/` directory.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Immediate Priority:** The sole focus must be on resolving the SQLite connection error.
- **Action Plan:** A detailed diagnostic and resolution prompt has been prepared for a follow-on AI instance. This prompt is located at `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-033559-fix-and-validate.md`. The plan involves adding diagnostic logging to `session.py` to identify the faulty path, implementing a robust fix, and then validating with both the database population and main pipeline scripts.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- There are no open questions at this time. The path forward is clear and documented in the active prompt file. The database issue must be resolved before any other work can continue.
