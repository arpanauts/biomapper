# Status Update: UKBB-HPA Configuration Resolution & Next Steps

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Resolved UKBB-HPA Protein Mapping Configuration Issue:**
    - Successfully identified and fixed the issue where the `UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE` was using stale test dataset paths from `metamapper.db` instead of the full dataset paths specified in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.
    - The solution involved:
        1.  Updating `protein_config.yaml` to ensure correct full dataset file paths in both the `databases` section (for endpoints) and the `mapping_clients` section (for file-based clients).
        2.  Recognizing that `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` is the correct tool to synchronize these YAML changes into `metamapper.db`.
    - Validated the fix by running the full mapping script (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`), which successfully processed 2,923 identifiers and mapped 465 (15.9%), using the correct full dataset files.
    - Generated CSV output of results at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/full_ukbb_to_hpa_mapping_results.csv`.
    - Documented this solution in MEMORY[9de2a760-6829-452b-b2c2-bba9c90cf953].
- **Created Detailed Prompts for Investigation:**
    - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-05-173800-resolve-ukbb-hpa-config-loading.md` was created to guide the resolution process.
- **Context from `2025-06-04-yaml-strategies-documentation-and-planning.md`:**
    - Significant progress on documenting YAML-defined mapping strategies (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/core_mapping_logic/yaml_defined_mapping_strategies.md`).
    - Created a guide for configuring UKBB/HPA/QIN protein mapping (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/guides/configuring_ukbb_hpa_qin_mapping.md`).
    - Refactored `MappingExecutor` resource management (async disposal, create method).

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall:** The Biomapper project has successfully configured and validated a key protein mapping pipeline (UKBB-HPA) using full datasets. The immediate blocker for this pipeline is resolved. The broader project focus remains on enhancing the YAML-defined mapping strategy execution capabilities.
- **UKBB-HPA Protein Mapping:** Stable and operational with full datasets. The generated CSV output and log summary are available, though report formatting is a to-do item for the future.
- **Configuration Management:** The two-tier configuration system (YAML as source of truth, `metamapper.db` as runtime, `populate_metamapper_db.py` as synchronizer) is understood and has been successfully utilized.
- **YAML-Defined Strategies:** Conceptual work and documentation are advancing. The next major phase involves implementing the `MappingExecutor` enhancements and action handlers to execute these strategies.
- **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:** None for the UKBB-HPA pipeline. For the broader YAML strategy work, the main blocker is the implementation of the execution logic in `MappingExecutor` and the action handlers.

## 3. Technical Context

- **Configuration Synchronization:** The critical role of `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` in translating YAML configurations (both `databases` for endpoints and `mapping_clients` for specific clients) into the `metamapper.db` is now a key understanding.
- **`MappingExecutor`:** While the immediate task didn't heavily modify `MappingExecutor`, its reliance on `metamapper.db` was central to the problem and solution. The previous refactoring for resource management (from 2025-06-04 status) was beneficial.
- **Data Files:**
    - Full UKBB protein metadata: `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/ukbb/UKBB_Protein_Meta.tsv`
    - Full HPA OSP protein CSV: `/procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/isb_osp/hpa_osps.csv`
    - Configuration: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`
    - Database: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper.db`
    - Results: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/full_ukbb_to_hpa_mapping_results.csv`

## 4. Next Steps

- **Improve Report Formatting (Deferred):** As per user request, improving the format and output of the mapping report (beyond the current CSV and log summary) will be addressed in a future session.
- **Continue YAML-Defined Strategy Implementation (Priority):**
    - **Address Code Duplication in `MappingExecutor`:** (From previous status) Investigate and refactor `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/0_backlog/refactor_mapping_executor_code_duplication.md`.
    - **Implement `MappingExecutor` Enhancements for YAML Strategies:**
        - Load and parse `mapping_strategies` from `metamapper.db` (requires updating `populate_metamapper_db.py` to handle this new YAML section).
        - Implement dispatch mechanism for `action.type`s to Python handlers.
        - Define data flow between strategy steps.
    - **Develop Initial Python Action Handler Modules:** For `CONVERT_IDENTIFIERS_LOCAL`, `EXECUTE_MAPPING_PATH`, `FILTER_IDENTIFIERS_BY_TARGET_PRESENCE`.
    - **Augment `protein_config.yaml` with a Test Strategy** and update `populate_metamapper_db.py`.
    - **Develop Integration Tests for YAML Strategies.**
- **Investigate Low Mapping Success Rate (Ongoing):** With the YAML strategy framework, revisit MEMORY[140ad7b0-e133-4771-a738-07e4b4926be6] to improve mapping success rates, particularly for UKBB data.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- (From previous status, still relevant for YAML strategies)
    - Data flow and state management within strategies.
    - Parameterization of `action.type` handlers.
    - Error handling and reporting for strategies.
    - Schema validation for `mapping_strategies` YAML.
    - Reusability and composition of strategies.
    - Impact on bidirectional reconciliation.
