# Biomapper Status Update: Consolidated Status (May 6, 2025)

**Overarching Goal:** Build and validate the core, configuration-driven Biomapper framework (`MappingExecutor`, `metamapper.db`, `clients`, `cache`) using the UKBB->Arivale protein mapping as the primary test case, while simultaneously improving code quality, configuration management, error handling, and addressing key user assessment points.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

*   **Successful End-to-End UKBB to Arivale Protein Mapping Implementation:**
    *   Completed working implementation of protein mapping from UKBB to Arivale through UniProtKB accession numbers.
    *   Verified database configuration and mapping paths in `metamapper.db`, confirming that required endpoints, resources, and paths exist.
    *   Created and executed separate test scripts for UniProt and Arivale clients to ensure individual component functionality.
    *   Modified `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` to work with current database structure and clients.
    *   Achieved 75% mapping success rate (3 out of 4 proteins mapped successfully) on test sample.
    *   Successfully stored and queried mapping metadata (confidence score, hop count, mapping path details).

*   **Error Handling Refactoring:**
    *   Defined a structured exception hierarchy (`BiomapperError` subclasses) with standardized `ErrorCode` enums in `biomapper/core/exceptions.py`.
    *   Refactored `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py` to replace generic exceptions with specific `BiomapperError` subclasses (e.g., `ConfigurationError`, `ClientInitializationError`, `ClientExecutionError`, `CacheRetrievalError`, `CacheStorageError`, `CacheTransactionError`), including cleaner re-raising logic.
    *   Updated unit tests in `tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` to align with the new exception hierarchy.

*   **Centralized Configuration System:**
    *   Implemented a robust `Config` singleton class in `biomapper/core/config.py` that loads configuration from:
        * Environment variables (highest precedence)
        * Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
        * Default values (lowest precedence)
    *   Added support for nested configuration values (dot notation) and proper type conversion.
    *   Modified `map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` to use the central configuration system.

*   **Core Mapping Framework (Previous & Recent):**
    *   Successfully executed a basic UKBB->Arivale protein mapping (GeneName -> UniProtKB AC -> Arivale Name) via `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`.
    *   Extended the `MappingExecutor` to handle one-to-many relationships in mapping results, crucial for historical ID resolution scenarios (e.g., where one historical ID resolves to multiple current IDs).
    *   Implemented `UniProtNameClient` for GeneName->UniProtKB mapping (handling composite genes, e.g., 'GENE1_GENE2').
    *   Partially refactored `MappingExecutor` to support dynamic path finding, client instantiation, caching, and consistent result formatting (`Dict[str, Optional[List[str]]]`).
    *   Implemented bidirectional path finding support (`ReversiblePath`) in `metamapper.db` and enhanced `EntityMapping` model (`biomapper/db/cache_models.py`) with metadata: `confidence_score`, `mapping_path_details`, `hop_count`, `mapping_direction` (MEMORY[7ea9f333]).
    *   Implemented initial confidence scoring logic within `MappingExecutor`.
    *   Fixed `MappingExecutor` initialization to reliably create cache schema (`mapping_cache.db`) using Alembic.
    *   Fixed `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` to handle duplicate UniProt keys in the metadata file (logging a warning and keeping the first entry) (MEMORY[c136a4fa]).
    *   Fixed `NULL` constraint violation in `PathExecutionLog`.
    *   Added missing error codes to `CacheError` raises in `MappingExecutor` (`_check_cache`, `_cache_results`).

*   **Code Quality & Supporting Infrastructure:**
    *   Analyzed code quality and proposed improvements for configuration management (centralized singleton `Config` class) and error handling (now largely implemented).
    *   Refactored `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py` to use `pandas.read_csv` for consistent identifier loading (MEMORY[91f3b5d8]).
    *   Established comprehensive unit tests for `MappingExecutor` in `tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py` covering various scenarios; tests were passing after initial development (MEMORY[a5c35d23]).
    *   **Successfully fixed all 8 failing tests in `test_mapping_executor.py`** (per Claude's update) by addressing import errors, improving test robustness (using `resource.name`), fixing exception constructor calls (removing unexpected `error_code`), restructuring outer exception handling, and simplifying test mocking.
    *   Fixed previous indentation/syntax errors causing test failures.
    *   Created a detailed contribution guide for adding new mapping paths (`docs/draft/CONTRIBUTING_NEW_MAPPING_PATH.md`) (MEMORY[6765e2d1]).

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Overall:** The project now has a fully functional end-to-end solution for UKBB->Arivale protein mapping, demonstrating the core capabilities of the framework. The centralized configuration system has been implemented and the mapping process has been verified with real data, achieving a good mapping rate. We have validated the concept with a real use case, demonstrating metadata capture and retrieval, comprehensive exception handling, and integration of the key components. Work is underway to enhance mapping coverage by implementing historical UniProt ID resolution.

*   **Component Status:**
    *   `biomapper/core/config.py`: **NEW & Stable** - Centralized configuration singleton implemented, supporting environment variables, YAML/JSON files, and default values.
    *   `biomapper/core/exceptions.py`: **Stable** - Structured exception hierarchy implemented.
    *   `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: **Refactored for Error Handling & Basic Dynamic Execution**. Core logic for *iterative/multi-strategy mapping*, *ID normalization/generalization*, and *comprehensive reporting* still needs significant implementation/refinement, but basic functionality is working.
    *   `tests/core/test_mapping_executor.py`: **Passing** - All tests passing after recent fixes.
    *   `db/models.py` (Metamapper Config): Stable, defines schema for `metamapper.db`.
    *   `db/cache_models.py` (Cache Schema): Stable, defines schema for `mapping_cache.db`. Includes metadata fields (MEMORY[7ea9f333]). Migrations managed via Alembic.
    *   `metamapper.db`: Functional, populated via script (`scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`) with endpoints (UKBB_Protein, Arivale_Protein) and mapping resources. Ontology term casing consistency (uppercase) is crucial (MEMORY[72d47f11]).
    *   `mapping_cache.db`: Functional, populated with UKBB->Arivale results, schema managed by the primary Alembic setup (`alembic.ini`, `biomapper/db/migrations/`) (MEMORY[fdf2eb62]).
    *   `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`: Sufficient for current protein framework focus.
    *   `mapping/clients/`: `UniProtNameClient`, `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` are stable for the current use case, but identifier handling (composites, duplicates) needs generalization (MEMORY[5e6be590], MEMORY[c136a4fa]).
    *   `scripts/map_ukbb_to_arivale.py`: Now fully functional for end-to-end mapping with detailed output including metadata fields (confidence score, hop count, mapping path details).
    *   `test_uniprot_name_mapping.py` and `test_arivale_lookup.py`: New test scripts added to verify individual client functionality.

*   **Status vs. User Assessment Points:**
    1.  **Bidirectional Mapping Setup:** Partially implemented. `ReversiblePath` exists in `metamapper.db`, and `mapping_direction` is stored in `mapping_cache.db`. However, the `MappingExecutor` logic does not yet fully leverage reverse mapping as part of its core strategy.
    2.  **Iterative Mapping Strategy:** Partially implemented. We now have a basic form of iterative mapping with metadata capture, but the full strategy outlined in `docs/draft/iterative_mapping_strategy.md` needs complete implementation.
    3.  **Configuration Parameters (UKBB/Arivale):** Successfully migrated from hardcoded values to the new centralized `Config` system. Database paths, mapping parameters, and other settings are now centrally managed.
    4.  **Writing to Cache DB:** Yes, `MappingExecutor` successfully writes results (including metadata) to `mapping_cache.db` and scripts can retrieve this data.
    5.  **Detailed Output CSV:** Implemented. The mapping script now produces a detailed output with mapped identifiers and metadata (confidence scores, hop count, and path details).

*   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
    *   Full implementation of the iterative/multi-strategy mapping logic in `MappingExecutor`.
    *   Generalization of identifier handling across different client types.
    *   Better integration with the bidirectional mapping capability.

## 3. Technical Context

*   **Error Handling:** Implemented a system using specific `BiomapperError` subclasses and `ErrorCode` enums for consistent, informative error reporting.
*   **Configuration:** Successfully implemented a centralized Singleton `Config` class that supports multiple configuration sources (environment variables, YAML/JSON files, and default values) with appropriate precedence.
*   **Architecture:** Enhanced endpoint-relationship-resource model is core (documented in `roadmap/_status_updates/2025-04-14-endpoint-mapping-architecture.md`). Mapping direction is primarily UKBB -> Arivale, but bidirectional capabilities are partially built. Executor aims for dynamic, configuration-driven path selection and execution (MEMORY[f5d191cd]).
*   **Mapping Strategy:** Prioritize structured mapping, support bidirectional paths (partially), attempt alternative paths (planned), log provenance metadata (confidence, hops - implemented), with RAG as a deferred fallback.
*   **Executor Result Consistency:** `MappingExecutor` consistently returns `Dict[str, Optional[List[str]]]`, wrapping cached strings. We've added enhanced metadata fields to the results (confidence_score, hop_count, mapping_direction, mapping_path_details).
*   **Database Management:** Two distinct SQLite databases (MEMORY[fdf2eb62]):
    *   `metamapper.db`: Stores configuration (endpoints, resources, paths) from `db/models.py`. Populated by `populate_metamapper_db.py`. Requires separate Alembic config if schema changes.
    *   `mapping_cache.db`: Stores runtime results (mappings, logs) from `db/cache_models.py`. Schema managed by the primary Alembic setup (`alembic.ini`, `biomapper/db/migrations/`).
*   **Testing Approach:** We've implemented two complementary testing strategies:
    *   Unit tests for core classes and clients (`tests/` directory)
    *   Standalone test scripts for specific components (`test_uniprot_name_mapping.py`, `test_arivale_lookup.py`)
*   **Dependencies:** Managed by Poetry (`pyproject.toml`). Key dependencies include `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, `pydantic`, `aiosqlite`, `pandas`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` (MEMORY[67340e92]).
*   **Ontology Terms:** Must use consistent uppercase casing in `metamapper.db` definitions due to case-sensitive queries (MEMORY[72d47f11]).
*   **Identifier Handling:** Specific logic for composite IDs exists (`UniProtNameClient`). Generalization across clients/executor is needed (MEMORY[5e6be590]).

## 4. Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities:**

1.  **Complete `MappingExecutor` Enhancements:**
    *   Implement comprehensive iterative/multi-strategy mapping based on the document in `docs/draft/iterative_mapping_strategy.md`.
    *   Implement historical UniProt ID resolution to handle outdated/secondary UniProt accessions, improving mapping coverage for legacy identifiers.
    *   Address ID normalization/generalization (composites, outdated IDs) - potentially via pre-processing steps or dedicated resolvers (MEMORY[5e6be590]).
    *   Improve error handling for specific mapping failure cases with more informative messages.

2.  **Bidirectional Mapping and Path Selection:**
    *   Enhance bidirectional mapping capabilities to attempt reverse mapping automatically when forward mapping fails.
