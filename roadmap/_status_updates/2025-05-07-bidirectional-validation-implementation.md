# Biomapper Status Update: Bidirectional Validation Implementation (May 7, 2025)

**Overarching Goal:** Build and validate the core, configuration-driven Biomapper framework (`MappingExecutor`, `metamapper.db`, `clients`, `cache`) using the UKBB->Arivale protein mapping as the primary test case, while simultaneously improving code quality, configuration management, error handling, and addressing key user assessment points.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments

* **Bidirectional Validation Feature Implementation:**
  * Implemented a three-tiered validation status system (Validated, UnidirectionalSuccess, Failed) for mapping results.
  * Added a new `validate_bidirectional` parameter to `execute_mapping` method in `MappingExecutor`.
  * Developed the `_reconcile_bidirectional_mappings` method to enrich mapping results with validation status.
  * Created a test script (`scripts/test_bidirectional_validation.py`) to verify the implementation.
  * Preserved backward compatibility by maintaining the existing API structure while adding enriched metadata.

* **Bidirectional Mapping Architecture Improvements:**
  * Enhanced the mapping executor to find and execute reverse mappings (target→source) for validation.
  * Added support for validating target identifiers by checking if they map back to their original source.
  * Implemented a detailed logging system to track validation success rates.
  * Ensured all forward mappings are preserved regardless of validation status, enriching rather than filtering.

* **Previous Accomplishments (Continuing):**
  * Successful end-to-end UKBB to Arivale protein mapping implementation.
  * Error handling refactoring with structured exception hierarchy.
  * Composite identifier handling system implementation.
  * Centralized configuration system.
  * Core mapping framework with iterative mapping strategy.

## 2. Current Project State

* **Overall:** The project continues to evolve with the addition of the bidirectional validation feature, addressing one of the key outstanding issues identified in the previous status update. This enhancement provides users with better confidence in mapping results by differentiating between mappings that succeed bidirectionally and those that only succeed in the forward direction. The implementation preserves all successful forward mappings while adding validation metadata, offering a more nuanced understanding of mapping quality.

* **Component Status Updates:**
  * `biomapper/core/mapping_executor.py`: **Enhanced** - Added bidirectional validation capability with transparent integration into the existing mapping process.
  * `scripts/test_bidirectional_validation.py`: **NEW** - Test script to validate the bidirectional validation implementation.
  * Other components remain stable as detailed in the previous status update.

* **Status vs. User Assessment Points:**
  1. **Bidirectional Mapping Setup:** Significantly improved. The bidirectional validation implementation now leverages reverse mapping as part of its strategy, providing enhanced confidence in mapping results.
  2. **Iterative Mapping Strategy:** Remains partially implemented as described in previous status.
  3. **Configuration Parameters:** Unchanged, successfully managed through the centralized `Config` system.
  4. **Writing to Cache DB:** Continues to successfully write results to `mapping_cache.db`, now including validation status metadata.
  5. **Detailed Output CSV:** Expanded with validation status information for each mapping.

* **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
  * ✅ Better integration with the bidirectional mapping capability. (COMPLETED with bidirectional validation implementation)
  * Remaining issues involve testing coverage and optimization as detailed in Next Steps.

## 3. Technical Context

* **Bidirectional Validation Architecture:**
  * **Three-Tiered Status System:** The implementation provides a three-tiered status for mapping results:
    * **Validated:** Mappings that succeed bidirectionally (have `validation_status` = "Validated")
    * **UnidirectionalSuccess:** Mappings that succeed only in the S→T direction (have `validation_status` = "UnidirectionalSuccess")
    * **Failed:** IDs that don't appear in `successful_mappings` at all
  * **Enrichment vs. Filtering:** The implementation enriches mapping results with validation status rather than filtering, preserving all forward mappings.
  * **Independent Reverse Mapping:** The validation process executes a fresh T→S mapping using the same underlying machinery as the primary mapping, ensuring thoroughness.

* **Implementation Details:**
  * The `validate_bidirectional` parameter controls whether to perform bidirectional validation.
  * The process extracts all target IDs from successful forward mappings to validate.
  * It finds an appropriate reverse mapping path using `_find_best_path`.
  * The reverse mapping is executed using `_execute_path` with swapped ontologies.
  * Results are reconciled using `_reconcile_bidirectional_mappings` which checks if targets map back to their sources.

* **Previous Technical Context (Continuing):**
  * Error handling system with specific `BiomapperError` subclasses.
  * Centralized Singleton `Config` class for configuration management.
  * Enhanced endpoint-relationship-resource model.
  * Consistent result format with enhanced metadata fields.
  * Two distinct SQLite databases (`metamapper.db` and `mapping_cache.db`).
  * Comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests and standalone scripts.

2. **Enhance Bidirectional Mapping Logic:**
   * Refine confidence scoring based on bidirectional validation results.
   * Implement more sophisticated path selection logic that considers validation status.
   * Add configuration options for specifying validation thresholds and strategies.

* Address scalability and performance improvements.
* Expand test coverage for new features and edge cases.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

* **Validation Strategy Refinement:**
  * What thresholds of validated vs. unidirectional mappings indicate potential issues with the mapping process?
  * How should confidence scores be adjusted based on validation status?

  * How to optimize bidirectional validation for very large datasets?
  * When is it appropriate to skip validation for performance reasons?
  * Can we implement smarter caching strategies specifically for validation?

* **User Experience:**
  * What's the most intuitive way to present validation status to users?
  * Should we provide visual indicators or filtering options in CSV outputs?
  * How to balance technical details vs. simplicity in validation reporting?

* **Integration with Other Features:**
  * How does bidirectional validation interact with composite identifier handling?
