## Context Brief
The Biomapper project has recently resolved a major performance bottleneck in the `MappingExecutor` by implementing client caching, leading to significant speedups. Additionally, `populate_metamapper_db.py` was updated with new UKBB/Arivale resources, and a key bug in `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`'s one-to-many logic was fixed. The roadmap has been updated to reflect these completions.

## Initial Steps
1.  Review the overall project context and goals in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/CLAUDE.md`.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the latest completed features and their documentation:
    *   MappingExecutor Performance: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/mapping_executor_performance_optimization/summary.md`
    *   Populate DB Update: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/update_populate_metamapper_db_ukbb_arivale/summary.md`
    *   Phase 3 Bug Fix: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/3_completed/fix_phase3_one_to_many_bug/summary.md`
3.  Review the latest full status update: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-05-30-session-recap-and-roadmap-update.md`.

## Work Priorities
1.  **Monitor and Validate Performance:**
    *   Design and execute tests for `MappingExecutor` using larger, production-representative datasets to confirm sustained performance and identify any new, more subtle bottlenecks.
2.  **Architecture Refinements (Post-Fixes):**
    *   Discuss and potentially implement cache management strategies (e.g., LRU, size limits) for `MappingExecutor._client_cache`.
    *   Evaluate if `ArivaleMetadataLookupClient` requires refactoring given its role as a generic file loader.
    *   Plan and add more comprehensive unit tests for `phase3_bidirectional_reconciliation.py`.
3.  **Data Quality and Mapping Validation:**
    *   Focus on validating the output of mapping runs, particularly for newly integrated UKBB data. Investigate any low mapping success rates, potentially linking back to data quality issues (e.g., malformed gene names).
4.  **Backlog Prioritization:**
    *   Review `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/README.md` and items in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/1_backlog/` to select and plan the next development sprint.

## Workflow Integration
Consider using Claude to:
-   Analyze mapping output statistics and identify patterns of low success.
-   Draft unit test cases for the architectural refinement tasks.
-   Help research and compare different cache management strategies (e.g., LRU, LFU, TTL) in the context of Python and the `MappingExecutor`'s usage pattern.
