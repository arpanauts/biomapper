# Suggested Next Work Session Prompt

## Context Brief
We are in the final stages of debugging the refactored mapping pipeline. A series of `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions have been systematically resolved, but the pipeline is still not operational. The immediate blocker is an import error for the `biomapper.utils.logging` module, which was removed during refactoring.

## Initial Steps
1.  **Review the Active Prompt:** Begin by reviewing the detailed instructions in the active prompt: `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/2025-06-18-115530-debug-modulenotfound-biomapper-utils.md`. This contains the full context and a step-by-step plan to resolve the final import error.
2.  **Review the Session Summary:** Read the latest status update for a complete overview of our last session: `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-18-session-summary.md`.

## Work Priorities

### Priority 1: Resolve the Final Import Error
- **This is the primary blocker.** The pipeline cannot run until this is fixed.
- Execute the plan outlined in the active prompt to modify `/home/ubuntu/Software-Engineer-AI-Agent-Atlas/biomapper/biomapper/core/engine_components/path_execution_manager.py`.
- This involves replacing the removed utility functions with standard Python libraries (`logging` and `datetime`).

### Priority 2: Full Pipeline Validation
- Once the import error is resolved, run the main pipeline script to ensure it executes from end-to-end without crashing:
  - `python scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`
- Monitor the output for any new runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

## Workflow Integration
- The next session is a focused debugging and validation effort. The primary task is to execute the fix detailed in the active prompt. There is a known issue with the `claude` CLI tool (`error: unknown option '--non-interactive'`), so the fix may need to be applied manually or the CLI command adjusted.
