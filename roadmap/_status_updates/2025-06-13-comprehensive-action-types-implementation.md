# Status Update: Comprehensive Action Types Implementation & Strategy Optimization

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

- **Implemented Complete Bidirectional Mapping Strategy:**
  - Discovered inefficiency in current UKBB→HPA strategy (unnecessary gene→UniProt→gene conversions)
  - Designed optimized `UKBB_TO_HPA_BIDIRECTIONAL_OPTIMIZED` strategy using direct UniProt matching
  - Created `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/main_pipelines/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping_bidirectional.py` implementing the new approach
  - Demonstrated "The Biomapper Way" - assume complexity, handle it gracefully, optimize when proven necessary

- **Successfully Deployed Three New Action Types via Parallel Development:**
  - **BIDIRECTIONAL_MATCH** - Direct matching with composite/M2M support, context tracking of matched/unmatched
  - **RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_FORWARD** - Historical resolution of source IDs with matching to target
  - **RESOLVE_AND_MATCH_REVERSE** - Reverse resolution maximizing coverage from target side
  - All actions include comprehensive test suites (10/10, full coverage, edge cases handled)
  - Registered in MappingExecutor dispatch logic and properly exported

- **Fixed Critical Context Persistence Bug:**
  - Identified that context wasn't persisting between strategy steps
  - Root cause: Each action was getting a fresh context copy instead of shared strategy context
  - Solution: Modified MappingExecutor to use strategy context directly (`context = strategy_context`)
  - Now actions can successfully pass data between steps via context keys

- **Created Comprehensive Documentation System:**
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant guidelines for action development
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/template_action.py.template` - Standard template
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/smart_action_types/smart_action_types.md` - Future vision
  - `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/action_types/developing_new_action_types.md` - Step-by-step guide

## 2. Current Project State

- **Overall:** Biomapper now has a powerful action-based architecture enabling sophisticated multi-step mapping strategies with context-based coordination between steps.

- **Action Types System:**
  - 7 action types total: CONVERT_IDENTIFIERS_LOCAL, EXECUTE_MAPPING_PATH, FILTER_IDENTIFIERS_BY_TARGET_PRESENCE, plus 3 new bidirectional actions
  - All actions support composite identifiers and many-to-many relationships by default
  - Context persistence enables complex workflows with data passing between steps
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all actions

- **Strategy Configuration:**
  - Successfully separated strategies into `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/mapping_strategies_config.yaml`
  - Added multiple strategy variations for UKBB→HPA mapping (original, bidirectional, direct gene)
  - Configuration-driven approach working smoothly with metamapper.db

- **Pipeline Status:**
  - Original UKBB→HPA pipeline functional (487 mapped from 2923 input)
  - New bidirectional pipeline ready for full dataset testing
  - Test script validates basic functionality with small dataset

- **Outstanding Issues:**
  - Performance optimization needed for large-scale UniProt resolution (2991 HPA IDs timeout)
  - Jupyter notebooks still need async handling updates
  - Strategy comparison framework not yet implemented

## 3. Technical Context

- **Architecture Decisions:**
  - **Context as First-Class Citizen**: Modified MappingExecutor to maintain strategy context across steps
  - **Composite-First Design**: All actions handle composites by default, not as special case
  - **Parameter Processing**: Strip "context." prefix from YAML parameters for cleaner action code
  - **Direct Context Sharing**: Use strategy context object directly instead of copying

- **Key Patterns Established:**
  - **Action Interface**: Consistent execute() method signature across all actions
  - **Early Exit Pattern**: Check for empty input and return standard empty result
  - **Provenance Tracking**: Detailed tracking of all transformations and decisions
  - **Flexible Parameters**: Optional parameters with sensible defaults

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - UniProt API batch size of 100 IDs works well for small datasets
  - Need parallel API calls or better caching for thousands of IDs
  - Context operations are lightweight - no performance impact observed

- **Testing Insights:**
  - Mocking at the right level (e.g., `map_identifiers` for UniProt client) crucial
  - `@pytest.mark.asyncio` required for all async test methods
  - Monkeypatch targets must account for import locations

## 4. Next Steps

- **Immediate Tasks:**
  - Optimize UniProt resolution batching for large datasets
  - Run full UKBB dataset through both strategies for comparison
  - Document performance metrics and coverage differences

- **Short-term Priorities:**
  - Create strategy comparison framework (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/analysis_and_reporting/compare_mapping_strategies.py`)
  - Update Jupyter notebooks with async handling and new strategy demonstrations
  - Add progress callbacks to long-running operations

- **Medium-term Goals:**
  - Implement smart action types as designed in roadmap
  - Create action composition patterns documentation
  - Build strategy recommendation engine based on dataset characteristics

- **Dependencies:**
  - Performance optimization should precede full dataset testing
  - Strategy comparison framework needed before making claims about improvements

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

- **Performance vs Coverage Trade-off:** How much slower is bidirectional resolution vs coverage gained?
- **Batch Size Optimization:** What's the optimal batch size for UniProt API calls?
- **Caching Strategy:** Should we cache UniProt resolutions more aggressively?
- **Action Granularity:** Are current actions at the right level of abstraction?
- **Strategy Selection:** Need guidelines for when to use which strategy variant
- **Progress Tracking:** How to best communicate progress during long operations?
- **Memory Efficiency:** Will context tracking scale to millions of identifiers?

## Parallel Development Success

The parallel Claude instance approach worked exceptionally well:
- Three complex actions implemented simultaneously
- Each instance maintained focus on their specific action
- All produced high-quality, well-tested code
- Issues encountered and resolved independently
- Total development time dramatically reduced

This validates the approach of using multiple AI assistants for parallel development of well-defined, independent components.
