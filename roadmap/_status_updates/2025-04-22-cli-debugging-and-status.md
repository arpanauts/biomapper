# Biomapper Development Status Update - 2025-04-22

Based on recent development and debugging sessions for the Biomapper project.

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **Asynchronous Refactoring:** Refactored `RelationshipPathFinder` ([biomapper/mapping/relationships/path_finder.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/relationships/path_finder.py:0:0-0:0)) and `RelationshipMappingExecutor` ([biomapper/mapping/relationships/executor.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/relationships/executor.py:0:0-0:0)) to utilize `asyncio` and `AsyncSession` for non-blocking database operations, improving potential performance and concurrency.
- **CLI Command Integration:** Successfully integrated and debugged the `biomapper relationship map-data` CLI command ([biomapper/cli/relationship_commands.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/cli/relationship_commands.py:0:0-0:0)).
- **Database Connection Resolved:** Fixed issues where the CLI was connecting to the wrong database (`mapping_cache.db` instead of `metamapper.db`). Ensured the `BIOMAPPER_DB_PATH` environment variable is correctly used to specify the database location ([biomapper/db/session.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/db/session.py:0:0-0:0)).
- **Schema Mismatch Fixed:** Corrected SQL queries in `path_finder.py` and `executor.py` that were referencing a non-existent `config` column in the `endpoints` table; the correct column `connection_info` is now used.
- **Method Call Fixed:** Resolved an `AttributeError` in the `map-data` CLI command by correcting the method call from the non-existent `map_data_through_relationship` to the correct `map_from_endpoint_data` on the `RelationshipMappingExecutor` instance.
- **CLI Command Executable:** The `biomapper relationship map-data` command now executes without runtime errors when provided with valid arguments and the correct database path.

## 2. Current Project State
- **Overall Status:** The core architecture separating endpoints and mapping resources is in place (Memory: f5d191cd-b5ec-4d9b-ab87-543799a0071c). The `metamapper.db` database contains the necessary schema and reference data for endpoints, relationships, and mapping resources (Memory: 52fb2518-677d-468d-9803-6873261b7654). The CLI can connect to the database and initiate mapping operations.
- **Mapping Execution:** The `RelationshipMappingExecutor` currently uses **simulated** mapping logic within its `map_entity` method. It successfully identifies the correct mapping path from the database but returns placeholder/dummy results (e.g., `mapped_HMDB0000123`) instead of performing actual lookups against mapping resources like UniChem.
- **Database Interaction:** Core database interactions within the mapping components (`path_finder.py`, `executor.py`) rely on raw SQL strings (`sqlalchemy.text`) because SQLAlchemy models for tables like `endpoints`, `relationships`, `mapping_paths`, etc., are not defined in [biomapper/db/models.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/db/models.py:0:0-0:0) (which currently focuses on caching models).
- **CLI:** The relationship mapping CLI command (`map-data`) is functional at a basic level but relies on the simulated mapping executor. Other CLI command groups (`health`, `metadata`, `metamapper`) have basic registration in place.
- **Blockers:** The primary blocker is the lack of real mapping implementation in the `RelationshipMappingExecutor`. The reliance on raw SQL is a potential maintenance concern.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architecture:** Endpoint/Mapping Resource separation allows flexible relationship definitions. Endpoints have preferred ontologies. Relationships link endpoints, and `relationship_mapping_paths` link specific ontology transitions within a relationship to concrete `mapping_paths`.
- **Asynchronicity:** `asyncio` and SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession` are used for database operations in the mapping flow to avoid blocking.
- **Database Schema:** Core tables (`endpoints`, `endpoint_relationships`, `mapping_paths`, etc.) exist in `metamapper.db` but lack corresponding SQLAlchemy ORM models. The `endpoints` table uses `connection_info` (TEXT column storing JSON) for configuration.
- **Configuration:** Database path is configured via the `BIOMAPPER_DB_PATH` environment variable.
- **Endpoint Adapters:** An adapter pattern (`biomapper.mapping.adapters`) exists (e.g., `CSVAdapter`) to extract identifying information from different endpoint data formats based on ontology preferences.
- **Codebase Learnings:** Debugging revealed mismatches between code assumptions (e.g., column names like `config`) and the actual database schema (`connection_info`). Confirmed the necessity of defining core ORM models.

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Implement Real Mapping:** Replace the simulated mapping logic in `RelationshipMappingExecutor.map_entity` with actual calls to mapping resources (e.g., query UniChem based on steps defined in `mapping_paths.path_steps`). This likely involves creating client classes or functions for interacting with these resources.
2.  **Define Core ORM Models:** Create SQLAlchemy models in `biomapper.db.models` for the core tables (`endpoints`, `endpoint_relationships`, `relationship_mapping_paths`, `mapping_paths`, etc.) currently accessed via raw SQL. Refactor `path_finder.py` and `executor.py` to use these ORM models.
3.  **Refine `map-data` Output:** Update the CLI command to display more meaningful results based on the actual mapping output.
4.  **Add Integration Tests:** Create integration tests that run the `map-data` command against the real database and verify the correctness of the mapping results (once real mapping is implemented).

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- **Mapping Resource Interaction:** How should the `RelationshipMappingExecutor` dispatch calls to different mapping resources (UniChem, KEGG, etc.) based on the `path_steps` retrieved from the database? Will a central "MetamappingEngine" or dispatcher be introduced, as hinted in comments?
- **Error Handling:** How should errors during the actual mapping process (e.g., API errors from UniChem, no match found) be handled, logged, and reported back through the CLI?
- **Confidence Scoring:** How will confidence scores be calculated and aggregated across multi-step mapping paths? The current simulation uses a fixed 0.95.
- **Caching Integration:** How will the entity mapping cache ([biomapper/db/models.py](cci:7://file:///home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/db/models.py:0:0-0:0)) be integrated with the `RelationshipMappingExecutor` to store and retrieve results?
