# Status Update: UniProt Client Fix, Pipeline Validation & Next Steps

## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)

-   **Fixed and Verified `UniProtHistoricalResolverClient`:**
    -   Resolved a critical bug in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/uniprot_historical_resolver_client.py` related to inconsistent return types between its `_resolve_batch` method (returned dict) and `map_identifiers` method (expected tuple), which caused "too many values to unpack" errors. (Ref: Checkpoint Summary, MEMORY[7dcf166d-5ba4-4041-b8c8-ec2b2e96c9f9])
    -   Improved composite UniProt ID handling in `map_identifiers` to aggregate results and metadata from all components, rather than only the first. (Ref: Checkpoint Summary)
    -   Successfully re-verified the client using a comprehensive standalone test script (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/validation/test_uniprot_client_standalone.py`). All test cases, including diverse single, composite, invalid, and empty UniProt IDs, passed, confirming robust handling. (Ref: Checkpoint Summary, Feedback: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_active_prompts/feedback/2025-06-12-010000-FEEDBACK_REVERIFY_CLIENT_AFTER_FIXES.md`)
    -   The client now correctly reflects the current state of IDs in the UniProt database.
-   **Resolved UKBB-HPA Protein Mapping Configuration Issue (Context from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-06-ukbb-hpa-config-resolution.md`):**
    -   Fixed issue where the `UKBB_TO_HPA_PROTEIN_PIPELINE` was using stale test dataset paths from `metamapper.db` instead of full dataset paths from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.
    -   Solution involved updating `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` and running `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to synchronize changes.
    -   Validated by running the full mapping script (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/run_full_ukbb_hpa_mapping.py`), which successfully processed 2,923 identifiers and mapped 465 (15.9%). Results at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/data/results/full_ukbb_to_hpa_mapping_results.csv`.
-   **Advanced YAML-Defined Mapping Strategies Documentation (Context from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-04-yaml-strategies-documentation-and-planning.md`):**
    -   Created detailed technical note: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/technical_notes/core_mapping_logic/yaml_defined_mapping_strategies.md`.
    -   Created guide for UKBB/HPA/QIN protein mapping: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/guides/configuring_ukbb_hpa_qin_mapping.md`.
    -   Refactored `MappingExecutor` resource management (added `async_dispose()` and `create()` methods).
-   **Aligned `protein_config.yaml` and Validated YAML System (Context from `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-03-protein-config-alignment.md`):**
    -   Updated `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml` to align with the iterative mapping strategy.
    -   Validated the refactored `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` script with the updated protein configuration.

## 2. Current Project State

-   **Overall:** The Biomapper project has significantly improved the robustness of its core UniProt resolution capabilities and has a validated protein mapping pipeline (UKBB-HPA) using full datasets. The immediate focus is on validating this pipeline end-to-end with the corrected client, followed by continued implementation of YAML-defined mapping strategies.
-   **`UniProtHistoricalResolverClient`:** Stable, fixed, and verified. Located at `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/uniprot_historical_resolver_client.py`. Ready for integration and use in full pipelines.
-   **UKBB-HPA Protein Mapping Pipeline:** Configuration issues are resolved. The immediate next step is to re-run the full notebook (`/home/ubuntu/biomapper/notebooks/mapping_pipelines/ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb`) to confirm end-to-end functionality with the fixed UniProt client.
-   **Configuration Management:** The system of using YAML files (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`) as the source of truth, with `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` synchronizing changes to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper.db`, is well-established and functional.
-   **YAML-Defined Strategies:** Documentation and conceptual work are well-advanced. Implementation of the `MappingExecutor` enhancements and action handlers to execute these strategies is the next major development effort in this area.
-   **Outstanding Critical Issues/Blockers:**
    -   None for the `UniProtHistoricalResolverClient` or the immediate UKBB-HPA pipeline validation.
    -   For broader YAML strategy work, the main blocker remains the implementation of execution logic in `MappingExecutor` and the associated action handlers.

## 3. Technical Context

-   **`UniProtHistoricalResolverClient` Details:**
    -   The `_resolve_batch` method returns detailed dictionaries for each UniProt ID.
    -   The `map_identifiers` method now correctly transforms these dictionaries into the expected `Tuple[Optional[List[str]], str]` format and aggregates results for composite IDs. Caching mechanisms store this transformed tuple.
    -   Relies on the UniProt REST API, `aiohttp` for asynchronous requests, and `asyncio`.
-   **Configuration Synchronization Workflow:** Editing `*_config.yaml` files in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/` and then running `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` (with an optional `--drop-all` flag) to update `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/metamapper.db` is a critical and established process (Ref: MEMORY[631e6476-8513-4727-aa46-494041b7b79b]).
-   **Mandatory UniProt Resolution:** UniProt API resolution via `UniProtHistoricalResolverClient` or a similar mechanism is a core, non-optional step for protein mapping, particularly for "UniProt-complete" datasets (Ref: MEMORY[f09ede1e-390a-49dc-b881-513aebc117b5]).
-   **Provenance in Mappings:** Mappings must include detailed provenance, tracing how an ID was mapped, including metadata from clients like the UniProt resolver (e.g., 'primary', 'secondary', 'demerged', 'obsolete') (Ref: MEMORY[f09ede1e-390a-49dc-b881-513aebc117b5]).
-   **Handling Optional Dependencies:** Graceful handling of optional dependencies (e.g., `qdrant_client` for `PubChemRAGMappingClient` in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/mapping/clients/__init__.py`) is crucial to prevent unrelated module loading failures (Ref: MEMORY[560a69e8-b017-4655-abcd-d0be8a7e765e]).

## 4. Next Steps

-   **Validate Full UKBB-HPA Protein Pipeline (Immediate Priority):**
    -   Re-run the `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/notebooks/mapping_pipelines/ukbb_to_hpa_protein.ipynb` notebook.
    -   **Goal:** Ensure end-to-end functionality with the fixed `UniProtHistoricalResolverClient`, analyze output, and confirm successful execution and correct mapping results.
-   **Continue YAML-Defined Strategy Implementation (High Priority):**
    -   Address code duplication in `MappingExecutor` (Ref: `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/0_backlog/refactor_mapping_executor_code_duplication.md`).
    -   Implement `MappingExecutor` enhancements: load/parse `mapping_strategies` from `metamapper.db`, implement dispatch mechanism for `action.type`s to Python handlers, define data flow between strategy steps.
    -   Develop initial Python action handler modules (e.g., for `CONVERT_IDENTIFIERS_LOCAL`, `EXECUTE_MAPPING_PATH`).
    -   Update `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to parse and store the `mapping_strategies` section from YAML configurations into `metamapper.db`.
    -   Add a test strategy to `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/configs/protein_config.yaml`.
    -   Develop integration tests for YAML-defined strategies.
-   **Investigate Low Mapping Success Rate (Ongoing):**
    -   Once the YAML strategy framework is more mature, utilize it to revisit and improve mapping success rates, particularly for UKBB data. This involves ensuring robust UniProt resolution and correct handling of gene names/IDs (Ref: MEMORY[140ad7b0-e133-4771-a738-07e4b4926be6] mentioned in `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-06-ukbb-hpa-config-resolution.md`).
-   **Improve Report Formatting (Deferred):** Enhancing the mapping report format beyond the current CSV and log summary.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations

-   (From `/home/ubuntu/biomapper/roadmap/_status_updates/2025-06-06-ukbb-hpa-config-resolution.md`, still relevant for YAML strategies)
    -   Data flow and state management within YAML-defined strategies.
    -   Parameterization of `action.type` handlers: finalizing parameters and their passage from YAML.
    -   Error handling and reporting mechanisms for strategies (e.g., halt vs. fallback).
    -   Schema validation for the `mapping_strategies` YAML section.
    -   Reusability and composition of strategies (future consideration).
    -   Impact of YAML strategies on the bidirectional reconciliation process and output formatting.
-   **End-to-End Pipeline Performance:** After validating the UKBB-HPA notebook, assess overall performance and identify any new bottlenecks that may have arisen with the corrected client or other recent changes.
