## 1. Recent Accomplishments (In Recent Memory)
- **Database Population:**
    - Enhanced `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py` to delete the existing `metamapper.db` file before population, preventing potential unique constraint errors on reruns.
    - Added new endpoints to `populate_metamapper_db.py`: `UKBB_Protein`, `Arivale_Protein`, and `Arivale_Chemistry`.
- **Mapping Logic Debugging (`biomapper/mapping/relationships/executor.py`):**
    - Corrected `_get_best_relationship_path` to properly use `_get_preferred_target_ontology` for determining the target ontology based on `OntologyPreference`.
    - Fixed `execute_mapping` to correctly parse mapping step details (`resource_name`, `source`, `target`) and look up `resource_id` from `resource_name`.
    - Resolved an `ImportError` in `_update_path_usage` by correctly importing `update` from `sqlalchemy`.
    - Addressed an `AttributeError: type object 'MappingResource' has no attribute 'type'` in `_execute_mapping_step` by removing the invalid reference.
    - Added detailed DEBUG logging to `_get_preferred_target_ontology` to trace preference resolution.
- **Issue Identification:**
    - Identified that the current mapping failures in `scripts/test_ukbb_mapping.py` stem from the external UniChem API returning `404 Not Found` for the specific `PUBCHEM` IDs being tested when mapping to `CHEBI`, indicating UniChem lacks these specific mappings.
- **Configuration Correction:**
    - Verified that `MappingResource` IDs are auto-assigned based on the order of definition in `populate_metamapper_db.py`. Confirmed `UniChem` has `ID: 4`. Updated internal memory accordingly.
- **Testing:**
    - Configured `scripts/test_ukbb_mapping.py` to use `DEBUG` logging for detailed execution tracing.

## 2. Current Project State
- **Overall:** The Biomapper project's core mapping infrastructure (database schema, population, relationship execution engine) is largely in place and functional. The primary blocker is handling failures originating from external mapping resources (specifically UniChem 404s for the current test case).
- **Component Status:**
    - `db/models.py`: Stable. Defines the core schema.
    - `scripts/populate_metamapper_db.py`: Stable. Accurately populates the database with required endpoints, resources, paths, and preferences for current tests.
    - `mapping/relationships/executor.py`: Actively developed/debugged. The core logic for path finding, step execution, and caching appears sound, but robustness against external API failures needs improvement.
    - `clients/unichem.py` (and potentially others): The UniChem client interaction seems correct (URL construction), but the external service is the source of current failures.
    - `scripts/test_ukbb_mapping.py`: Functional for initiating the mapping process and revealing the UniChem 404 issue.
- **Stability:** Database schema and population are stable. Mapping execution logic is approaching stability but requires a strategy for handling external API limitations/failures.
- **Outstanding Issues:** The critical blocker is the consistent failure of the `PUBCHEM -> CHEBI` mapping via `UniChem` for the test data IDs, preventing successful end-to-end mapping in the `test_ukbb_mapping.py` scenario.

## 3. Technical Context
- **Architecture:** Follows the defined endpoint-relationship-resource model (See Memory [f5d191cd-b5ec-4d9b-ab87-543799a0071c]). Endpoints represent data sources/targets, Resources are mapping tools (APIs, ontologies), Relationships link endpoints with preferred ontology targets, and MappingPaths define the sequence of Resource steps to translate between ontologies.
- **Technology/Patterns:** Uses SQLAlchemy ORM (`models.py`) for database interaction with an SQLite backend (`metamapper.db`, `mapping_cache.db`). Employs `asyncio`/`await` for non-blocking database and HTTP client operations. Mapping paths are defined as lists of dictionaries in `MappingPath.steps`. A caching layer (`MappingCache`) attempts to store and retrieve successful mapping results.
- **Learnings:**
    - External API limitations are a significant factor; the system needs to be resilient to `404 Not Found` or other errors indicating missing data in external resources.
    - Resource IDs are dynamically assigned by SQLAlchemy based on insertion order within a session flush in the population script; relying on this order is crucial for interpreting logs and database entries.
    - Clear logging (especially DEBUG level) was essential for tracing the flow through `_get_preferred_target_ontology`, `_get_best_relationship_path`, `execute_mapping`, and `_execute_mapping_step`.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - `_get_preferred_target_ontology` queries `OntologyPreference` based on `EndpointRelationship.id`.
    - `_get_best_relationship_path` finds a `MappingPath` matching the source ontology and the *preferred* target ontology.
    - `_execute_mapping_step` uses the `MappingResource.name` (e.g., 'UniChem') to dispatch to the appropriate client method.
    - UniChem client uses EBI source IDs (e.g., 1 for CHEBI, 21 for PUBCHEM) in API calls.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Immediate Task:** Decide on and implement a strategy to handle the UniChem `404 Not Found` errors encountered in `test_ukbb_mapping.py`. The main options are:
    1.  **Accept Failures:** Log the failure and move on (current behavior).
    2.  **Change Preference:** Modify `OntologyPreference` in `populate_metamapper_db.py` for relationship 1 (Arivale->SPOKE) to prefer a different target (e.g., `PUBCHEM`) over `CHEBI` to avoid the failing UniChem call for this specific test.
    3.  **Add Alternative Path:** Define a new `MappingPath` in `populate_metamapper_db.py` for `PUBCHEM -> CHEBI` that uses different resources (if a reliable alternative exists).
    4.  **Enhance Executor:** Modify `RelationshipMappingExecutor` to try alternative mapping paths if the preferred one fails (more complex).
- **Priorities:** Resolve the mapping failure blocker to enable successful end-to-end testing for at least one significant mapping scenario (like the one in `test_ukbb_mapping.py`).
- **Dependencies:** The chosen strategy will determine modifications needed in `populate_metamapper_db.py` and/or `executor.py`.
- **Challenges:** Ensuring robustness against various external API failure modes. Defining comprehensive and reliable mapping paths if needed.

## 5. Open Questions & Considerations
- What is the desired system behavior when a preferred mapping path fails due to external resource limitations (e.g., UniChem 404)? Stop? Log and continue? Try alternatives automatically?
- Should the `OntologyPreference` model support ranked preferences (e.g., priority 1, 2, 3) to facilitate automatic fallback in the executor?
- Are the current `MappingPath` definitions sufficient for common use cases, or do we need to research and add more, potentially multi-step, paths?
- How effective is the current `MappingCache`? (Recent tests showed only misses; needs evaluation under successful mapping conditions).
- Should error handling be standardized across different mapping resource clients?
