# Fix Google Drive Access for Service Account

## The Issue
The service account can authenticate but gets "File not found" error for your folder ID. This means the service account doesn't have permission to access the folder.

## Solution

### Step 1: Get the Service Account Email
Look in your `google-credentials.json` file for the `client_email` field. It will look like:
```
"client_email": "biomapper-sync@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

### Step 2: Share the Folder with Service Account
1. Go to your Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tGkQps5DwaYn761J5DD-BNbETuGkLTeZ
2. Click the "Share" button (or right-click â†’ Share)
3. Add the service account email (from Step 1)
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Click "Send" (the service account won't actually receive an email, but will get access)

### Step 3: Verify Folder ID
Make sure the folder ID in your .env matches the one in the URL:
- URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/[FOLDER_ID]`
- Your folder ID: `1tGkQps5DwaYn761J5DD-BNbETuGkLTeZ`

### Step 4: Test Again
Once you've shared the folder, run the test again:
```bash
poetry run python test_google_drive_sync.py
```

## Alternative: Create a New Folder
If you prefer, the service account can create its own folder:

```python
# Modify the sync action to create a root folder
# This would require modifying the action to support root folder creation
```

## Expected Success Output
When it works, you should see:
- Files actually uploaded
- URLs returned for each file
- Files visible in your Google Drive folder
