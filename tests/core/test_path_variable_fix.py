This is a direct test for the fix to the UnboundLocalError in mapping_executor.py

We specifically test the code that was fixed:
```python
# Return the results in the expected format
# Make sure path_details and path_name are defined even if the path finding fails
path_name = None
if 'path_details' in locals() and path_details:
    path_name = path_details.get('path_name')
elif 'path' in locals() and path:
    path_name = getattr(path, 'name', None)
    
return {
    "status": PathExecutionStatus.SUCCESS.value if status == PathExecutionStatus.SUCCESS else status.value,
    "selected_path_name": path_name,
    "mapping_log_id": path_log.id if 'path_log' in locals() and path_log else None,
    "results": final_results if final_results else {},
    "source_ontology": source_ontology,
