# Summary of Changes That May Have Broken kg2c_normalized

## Timeline of Changes in This Session

### 1. Parameter Standardization (Early in session)
**What we changed:**
- `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/entities/proteins/annotation/extract_uniprot_from_xrefs.py`
  - Line 136: Changed `params.dataset_key` → `params.input_key`
  - This was to align with 2025 standardization

**Why this might break things:**
- If the YAML is passing `dataset_key` but the action expects `input_key`, it would fail
- BUT we also updated the YAML to use `input_key`, so this should be fine

### 2. Merge Datasets Validation Fix
**What we changed:**
- `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/merge_datasets.py`
  - Line 90: Changed validation from `self.dataset1_key` to `self.input_key`
  
**Impact:**
- This affects how merge validates parameters but shouldn't affect normalization

### 3. Parse Composite Identifiers Parameter Fix
**What we changed:**
- `biomapper/core/strategy_actions/utils/data_processing/parse_composite_identifiers.py`
  - Changed all `params.input_context_key` → `params.input_key`
  - Changed all `params.output_context_key` → `params.output_key`

**Impact:**
- Only affects composite parsing step, not the earlier normalization

### 4. YAML Strategy Updates
**What we changed in prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v3.0_progressive.yaml:**
- Replaced all FILTER_DATASET actions with CUSTOM_TRANSFORM
- Updated parse_composite_identifiers parameters:
  - `identifier_column` → `id_field`
  - `separators` → `patterns` (with different structure)
  - Added `output_format: flat`

## What DIDN'T Change (But Might Be The Problem)

### 1. The extract_uniprot_from_xrefs Action
- We changed the parameter access but NOT how it stores output
- The log shows it executes but no success message
- It might be silently failing

### 2. The normalize_accessions Action  
- We didn't touch this file at all in this session
- But it's not creating the expected output
- The log shows it starts processing but no completion

### 3. Context Handling
- The strategy uses mixed context types (dict vs Pydantic)
- Some actions might not handle both types correctly

## Most Likely Culprits

### Primary Suspect: extract_uniprot_from_xrefs
The execution log shows:
```
06:47:48,700 - Executing step 'extract_uniprot_from_kg2c' with action 'PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS'
06:47:51,200 - Executing step 'normalize_arivale_accessions' with action 'PROTEIN_NORMALIZE_ACCESSIONS'
```

**Notice**: 2.5 seconds pass but no success/completion message for extract_uniprot!

### Secondary Suspect: Column Mismatch
The YAML specifies:
```yaml
xrefs_column: xrefs
```

But we never verified that the kg2c_proteins.csv file actually HAS an 'xrefs' column!

### Tertiary Suspect: Context Type Issues
The error message mentions:
```
Context preference was: pydantic
```

Some actions might expect dict context but receive Pydantic, or vice versa.

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check if kg2c has xrefs column
head -1 /procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/kg2c_ontologies/kg2c_proteins.csv | grep -o "xrefs"

# Check what columns it actually has
head -1 /procedure/data/local_data/MAPPING_ONTOLOGIES/kg2c_ontologies/kg2c_proteins.csv

# See if extract_uniprot logs any warnings/errors we missed
grep -A5 -B5 "extract_uniprot_from_kg2c" /tmp/v3.0_final_run.log

# Check if the action is raising but catching exceptions
grep -n "except\|try" /home/ubuntu/biomapper/biomapper/core/strategy_actions/entities/proteins/annotation/extract_uniprot_from_xrefs.py
```

## Working vs Broken Comparison

### From prot_production_simple_working.yaml (WORKING):
```yaml
- name: extract_uniprot_from_kg2c
  action:
    type: PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS
    params:
      input_key: kg2c_raw
      xrefs_column: xrefs
      output_key: kg2c_with_uniprot
```

### From prot_arv_to_kg2c_uniprot_v3.0_progressive.yaml (BROKEN):
```yaml
- name: extract_uniprot_from_kg2c
  action:
    type: PROTEIN_EXTRACT_UNIPROT_FROM_XREFS
    params:
      input_key: kg2c_raw
      xrefs_column: xrefs
      output_key: kg2c_with_uniprot
```

**They're identical!** So the issue must be in the action implementation or the data.

## Recommended Investigation Path

1. **First**: Verify the kg2c_proteins.csv has an 'xrefs' column
2. **Second**: Check if extract_uniprot_from_xrefs is silently failing due to missing column
3. **Third**: Verify the context storage mechanism in both actions
4. **Fourth**: Check if the parameter standardization broke something we didn't catch

## Note for Investigating Agent

The issue is almost certainly in the extract_uniprot_from_xrefs step since:
- It executes but shows no success message
- The next step (normalize) can't find its output
- The normalize step works fine for arivale data

Focus your investigation there first!
